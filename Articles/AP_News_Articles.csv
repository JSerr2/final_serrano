Kraft Heinz stops serving school-designed Lunchables because of low demand,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A Lunchables package is shown on a grocery store shelf in New York on Tuesday, Nov. 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan) Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools. The company introduced the two packaged meals — one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate — at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program. Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias “a highly questionable move for school nutrition” that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option. The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies. Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.  In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as “negligible,” saying sales of the school-designed meals “were far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales” during the last academic year.  “Last year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,” the statement said. “This happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.” The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese.

Massachusetts joins a small but growing number of states adopting universal free school meals,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts has joined a small but growing number of states adopting universal free school meals programs. Spending for the program was included in an overdue $55.98 billion state budget signed into law by Democratic Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday. The budget covers the 2024 fiscal year that began July 1. The budget includes spending on schools, child care, workforce development, public transit, housing, climate resiliency and other key areas that will help make Massachusetts more affordable, competitive and equitable, said Healey, signing her first budget as governor. The budget will also make community college free for students aged 25 and older, expand grants for early education and care providers, increase funding for apprenticeships and other workforce development programs, and dedicate one percent of the budget to energy and the environment for the first time, she added. About $172 million in permanent funding is also included in the budget to provide universal school meals for public school students in kindergarten through high school. Healey called the school lunch program “an investment in childhood nutrition that’s also removing a source of stress from our schools and our homes.” The meals programs will save families about $1,200 per student, per year, Senate President Karen Spilka said. House Speaker Ronald Mariano, a fellow Democrat, said that as a former schoolteacher he saw firsthand the importance of ensuring that children have access to food during the school day.  “The school lunch program is something I’m extremely proud of,” said Mariano who taught school for 12 years and served on a local school committee. “I know the stresses of being in the classroom and seeing kids come in from the projects hungry, falling asleep at their desks because they haven’t eaten since lunch the day before.” Mariano said he sees the program as part of a larger effort to target childhood hunger. As of July, at least seven states — California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont — have established optional or mandatory universal school meal programs for schools participating in national school lunch and school breakfast programs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Six states mandate district participation and pay for the programs through general revenues or education funds. Colorado doesn’t mandate district participation and funds universal meals through a voter-passed tax measure that reduces income tax deductions for households earning $300,000 or more. Some states began looking for ways to create universal meals programs after a federal pandemic-era program that provided free meals for all public school students ended last year. Ensuring that all student have access to lunches helps break down the stigma of receiving free meals, said activists who have pushed for the change. “Universality means every kid has the food they need, no questions asked,” said Erin McAleer, president of the nonprofit Project Bread, who helped lead the push in Massachusetts. “Eliminating labels of ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ is long overdue. This milestone transforms a system that has been broken for decades.” For the first time, the Massachusetts budget also incorporates an estimated $1 billion in projected new revenue generated from the voter-approved “millionaire tax” amendment to the state constitution. The budget splits the new revenue between education and transportation initiatives. Healey said she also issued more than $200 million in vetoes to the budget delivered to her desk by state lawmakers. Fellow Democrats, who hold overwhelming majorities in both the Massachusetts House and Senate, will have the chance to override the vetoes if they want. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Wood noticed a “program fee” required each time she loaded money onto her daughter’s school lunch account. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) NEW YORK (AP) — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a $2.49 “program fee” each time she loaded money onto her daughter’s school lunch account. As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there’s rarely transparency around it. “It wouldn’t have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to dump into her account at the beginning of the year,” Wood said. “I didn’t. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I’d pay for six lunches, but only get five.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. “It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.  “A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.” Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s account. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. In Wood’s case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter’s Massachusetts school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter’s lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch policy. In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues to protest school processing fees for families. “Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to pay that fee,” Wood said. “They take money from people who need it the most.” While payment companies maintain that school districts have the chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.” The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for comment. Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in negotiating a contract. If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision, which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — When classrooms in California reopen for the fall term, all 6.2 million public school students will have the option to eat school meals for free, regardless of their family’s income. The undertaking, made possible by an unexpected budget surplus, will be the largest free student lunch program in the country. School officials, lawmakers, anti-hunger organizations and parents are applauding it as a pioneering way to prevent the stigma of accepting free lunches and feed more hungry children. “This is so historic. It’s beyond life-changing,” said Erin Primer, director of food services for the San Luis Coastal Unified School District on California’s central coast. Several U.S. cities including New York, Boston and Chicago already offer free school meals for all. But until recently, statewide universal meal programs were considered too costly and unrealistic. California became the first state to adopt a universal program late last month, and Maine followed shortly after with a similar plan. “We’ve completely leveled the playing field when it comes to school food,” Primer said. The extra funding will also allow her to offer tastier, better quality food such as fresh bread, produce and cheese from local producers, she said. Under federal rules, a family of four must make less than $34,000 a year to qualify for free meals and $48,000 to qualify for reduced-price meals. The caps shift annually but are based on federal poverty measures that don’t take into account the high cost of living and taxes in California.  “So it’s just for the most poor families, and not even all of them because some people failed to sign up or were fearful to sign up,” said Kat Taylor, a philanthropist and major funder of the Center for Ecoliteracy and the TomKat Ranch that backed California’s plan. About 60% of California students qualify, but experts say the number of children who need food assistance is much higher in a state with vast income inequality. Communities of color are disproportionately affected and immigrant communities in particular are fearful of applying because of detailed forms that ask intrusive questions such as their family income, Social Security number and children’s immigration status. Schools reported a declining percentage of families applying for free and reduced-price meals during the Trump administration, which attempted to tighten immigration policies and public benefits. Like school officials statewide, Primer has countless tales of children who struggled to pay for school meals or were too ashamed to eat for free. There was the child whose mother called Primer, distraught because she made a few hundred dollars too much to qualify; the father who is in the country illegally and feared that filling out the free meal application could get him deported; and constant cases of high schoolers not wanting friends to know they need free food, so they skip eating. When the pandemic hit, it changed everything — including how school meals were served — and provided an impetus for the universal program, which had bipartisan, unanimous support. Lawmakers previously had only pursued targeted bills such as easing school lunch debt. After schools shut in March 2020, many transformed their parking lots into pickup sites, and federal funding allowed schools to offer meals to anyone. There were no applications, qualifications and no questions asked. The massive turnout showed how much families rely on the meals. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the state’s largest with 600,000 students, handed out upward of 400,000 meals a day, said spokeswoman Shannon Haber. San Luis Coastal, with 7,500 students, gave out 30,000 meals a week at the height of the pandemic, nearly triple the number before. The district includes the wealthy city of San Luis Obispo and lower-income areas. “I thought it was a pipe dream for a long time,” said Sen. Nancy Skinner, a longtime advocate for universal free meals. Backed by over 200 organizations in a coalition called “School Meals for All,” Skinner and other lawmakers pushed for funding in the state budget, seizing the momentum at a time when California is flush with cash. The $262 billion budget provides $54 million for the coming school year, supplementing funding from the Biden administration through June 2022. After that, California will spend $650 million annually. “If you’re a hungry child, you’re not going to learn well,” said Skinner, a Democrat representing Berkeley. “Why should we have to go through a bureaucratic hassle to get a kid fed, when we could just have universal meals?” Senate Education Committee Republicans supported the plan as a way to help families struggling with California’s high cost of living. Sen. Brian Dahle, a Republican from a largely rural area of Northern California, said he had watched kids at his children’s school steal leftover food when cafeteria workers weren’t looking. “For a lot of them that was their dinner and they were sneaking it or taking it off someone’s plate when they didn’t finish it,” said Dahle. Schools rarely turn hungry kids away. But for children who didn’t qualify and needed lunch, their parents were billed and many racked up huge debts. In recent years some schools threatened to not let students graduate middle or high school until lunch debts were paid, or stamped the hands of students who owed money, said Jessica Bartholow, chief of staff for Skinner who previously was an anti-hunger advocate. Some schools would hire debt collectors to hound parents, but at the end of the year schools have to use general fund dollars to pay off lunch program debts, she said. For Tina Self, a mother of three, avoiding the cost of $3 school lunches every day will be an enormous relief. “It might seem like a little bit, but it helps a lot,” said Self, who lives in San Luis Obispo where a gallon of gas can cost just shy of $5 a gallon and rent is “crazy.” “Lucky for us we both have a job and we have two running cars,” she said of herself and her husband. “But we’re barely making it as it is.” Tony Wold, an associate superintendent of the West Contra Costa Unified School, says it’s about time lunches were free. “Just like you need to give students textbooks and a computer, there are certain things you need to do. And this is one of them,” Wold said. This story has been corrected to say that Kat Taylor is a major funder of the Center for Ecoliteracy, not its co-founder. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Lawmakers OK bill to get excess food to eligible students,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The General Assembly passed a bill that will allow Virginia schools to distribute excess food to eligible students, in an effort to provide another meal to students “Hunger is real in Virginia,” said Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William. “And it is pervasive.” The bill Roem introduced will allow school districts to create a program to distribute excess food to students eligible for the School Breakfast Program or National School Lunch Program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Roem said that many districts are already under pressure to make sure all the prepared food is served to students, but there are leftovers. Some days there will be more and other days there will be less, but inevitably there will be an excess, she said. The USDA also offers a federally-funded Afterschool Meals program. The program is optional, but Roem said several districts are starting to take advantage of it, including some in Prince William County. Students enrolled in the program are given a meal to take home with them. “We already know there’s existing precedent for distributing excess school meals at the end of the day,” Roem said. “We already know this works.” Roem wanted the language in her bill to make it explicitly clear that every school district in the state can participate. She said that the use of “may distribute” versus “shall distribute” in the legislation is to allow school districts to figure out their own method.  School breakfasts and lunches might be the only nutritious meals a child receives that day, Roem said. For some students, school lunch on a Friday might be the last meal they eat until Monday morning. “It doesn’t matter where you are in Virginia, every child should get fed,” Roem said. Roem, who has since her election to office efforted several pieces of legislation to increase student access to food, said those who opposed such bills often pose the question: “Isn’t it the responsibility of parents to feed their children?” “We wouldn’t have these programs if every parent in the entire country had to make sure that their kid goes off to school with a brown bag every day,” she said, slamming down her own bagged lunch. “But that’s not the reality.” The reality, she said, is that kids get hungry and kids go without food. Roem said although people complain about tax dollars and free markets, it is a responsibility of schools and governments to feed children. Matthew Stanley, the director of advocacy and outreach at Richmond Public Schools, said Roem’s bill is important to RPS and in alignment with their values. Stanley said that RPS is part of the Community Eligibility Provision, a program run by the USDA which provides free meals to students in the highest poverty school districts. Eligible schools are reimbursed for the distributed free meals. According to data from the Department of Education, all RPS schools are eligible for free lunch programs. “When we have long weekends or when we have to cancel school, we take those decisions really, really critically because we know that if we cancel school, we know that there are potentially kids that are not going to eat that day,” Stanley said. RPS sends meals home with children before long weekends or planned cancelations and also works with the city and the school districts’ student health services to provide meals during the summer, he said. Summer meals are distributed at city community centers to members of meal programs and others who are eligible. “We really try to do everything we can,” Stanley said. A Title 1 school is a federal designation that allocates more aid and funding to schools in high-poverty areas or with a high-poverty student body. There are 767 in the state. Students at these schools receive federally funded free meals. Roem pointed out that in Prince William, the district she represents, they are already utilizing food distribution programs. She wants to expand access and “make it work for everyone.” “It is part of the social contract that children do not go hungry in America, and that means that we need to do everything in our power to curtail that and to stop making it pervasive,” Roem said. Roem also recently passed a bill that will help individuals in Virginia with an annual income of less than $3,600 get a hot meal with their food stamps, from certain restaurants.

Ex-Arizona charter school principal sentenced in fraud case,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. PHOENIX (AP) — The former principal of a Goodyear charter school has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison and ordered to pay more than $2.5 million in restitution in a fraud case. State prosecutors said Harold Cadiz was sentenced for his role in enrolling fake students to obtain funding from the Arizona Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Cadiz worked at the now-closed Bradley Academy of Excellence, a K-8 charter school. Prosecutors said Cadiz reported hundreds of fake student profiles to the state education department to fraudulently get additional funding for the financially failing school. The fake students were enrolled in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s school lunch program during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 academic years. After the school abruptly closed its doors in December 2017, it was discovered Bradley Academy included 191 fake students in its reported enrollment of 652 in the 2016-17 school year and 453 fake students in its reported enrollment of 528 in 2017-18. That resulted in overpayments of about $2.2 million by the state Department of Education, more than $91,000 by the federal Department of Education and nearly $231,000 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger, File) Lab-grown meat is not currently available in any U.S. grocery stores or restaurants. If some lawmakers have their way, it never will be. Earlier this month, both Florida and Alabama banned the sale of cultivated meat and seafood, which is grown from animal cells. In Iowa, the governor signed a bill prohibiting schools from buying lab-grown meat. Federal lawmakers are also looking to restrict it. It’s unclear how far these efforts will go. Some cultivated meat companies say they’re considering legal action, and some states – like Tennessee – shelved proposed bans after lawmakers argued they would restrict consumers’ choices. Still, it’s a deflating end to a year that started with great optimism for the cultivated meat industry. The U.S. approved the sale of lab-grown meat for the first time in June 2023, allowing two California startups, Good Meat and Upside Foods, to sell cultivated chicken. Two high-end U.S. restaurants briefly added the products to their menus. Some cultivated meat companies began expanding production. One of Good Meat’s products went on sale at a grocery in Singapore. But before long, politicians were pumping the brakes. Lawmakers in seven states introduced legislation that would ban cultivated meat, according to Kim Tyrrell, an associate director with the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the U.S. Senate, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Republican Mike Rounds of South Dakota introduced a bill in January to prohibit the use of lab-grown meat in school lunch programs.  The backlash isn’t confined to the U.S. Italy banned the sale of lab-grown meat late last year. French lawmakers have also introduced a bill to ban it. The pushback is happening even though lab-grown meat and seafood are far from reaching the market in a meaningful way because they’re so expensive to make. Cultivated products are grown in steel tanks using cells from a living animal, a fertilized egg or a storage bank. The cells are fed with special blends of water, sugar, fats and vitamins. Once they’ve grown, they’re formed into cutlets, nuggets and other shapes. Companies have been heavily focused on scaling production to bring down costs and on winning government approval to sell their products. Now, they’re also trying to figure out how to respond to the state bans. Upside Foods launched a Change.org petition, inviting supporters to “tell politicians to stop policing your plate.” “It’s a shame they are closing the door before we even get out of the gate,” Tom Rossmeissl, the head of global marketing for Good Meat, said. The company is considering its legal options, he said. Backers of the bans say they want to protect farmers and consumers. Cultivated meat has only been around for about a decade, they say, and they’re concerned about its safety. “Alabamians want to know what they are eating, and we have no idea what is in this stuff or how it will affect us,” Republican state Sen. Jack Williams, the sponsor of Alabama’s bill, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. “Meat comes from livestock raised by hardworking farmers and ranchers, not from a petri dish grown by scientists.” But those within the cultivated meat industry say their products must meet rigorous government safety tests before going on sale. Their nascent industry isn’t trying to replace meat, they say, but figure out ways to feed the world’s growing need for protein. Rossmeissl said the U.S. is currently leading the effort to develop cultivated meat and seafood, with 45 companies in the space, but that could change. In January, for example, an Israeli company received preliminary approval to sell the world’s first steaks made from cultivated beef. China is also investing heavily in lab-grown meat. “It should be startling and concerning to Americans that we’re throwing up barriers to something that could be really important to our economy and food security,” he said. State Sen. Jay Collins, a Republican who sponsored the Florida bill, noted that the legislation doesn’t ban research, just the manufacturing and sale of lab-grown meat. Collins said safety was his primary motivator, but he also wants to protect Florida agriculture. “Let’s not be in a rush to replace something,” he said. “It’s a billion-dollar industry. We feed a ton of people across the country with our cattle, beef, pork, poultry and fish industries.” Rossmeissl thinks the meat industry is trying to avoid what happened to the dairy industry after the introduction of plant-based alternatives like oat milk. Plant-based milk made up 15% of U.S. milk sales last year; that’s up from around 6% a decade ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Good Food Institute, an advocacy group for plant-based and cultivated products. Meat producers did back the bans in Florida and Alabama. The leaders of those states’ cattlemen’s associations – which are advocacy groups for ranchers – stood next to both governors as they signed the bans into law. But the picture is more complicated at the national level, where the meat industry doesn’t support bans on cultivated products. Some meat producers, like JBS Foods, are working on developing cultivated meat of their own. “We do not support the route of banning these outright,” Sigrid Johannes, the director of government affairs for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said. “We’re not afraid of competing with these products in the marketplace.” The Meat Institute – which represents JBS, Tyson and other big meat companies – sent a letter to Alabama lawmakers warning them that the state’s ban was likely unconstitutional since federal law regulates meat processing and interstate commerce. The founders of Wildtype, a San Francisco-based company that makes cultivated salmon, traveled to Florida and Alabama to testify against the bills but weren’t able to sway the outcome. They hope someone will challenge the bans in court but say it’s not realistic for their tiny company to take on that battle. “We are David and on the other side of the aisle there is a gigantic Goliath,” Wildtype co-founder Arye Elfenbein said.

Council Bluffs Schools to offer all students free meals,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) — All students in the Council Bluffs school district will receive free meals beginning this fall. Lisa Stewart, director of nutrition services for the district, told the board of education this week that the entire school district now qualifies for Community Eligibility Provision, a federal program that allows students to eat free breakfast and lunch. The Daily Nonpareil reports families in elementary schools could say up to $700 a year, with families of high school students saving up to $900 a year. Stewart said the students qualified because of a state decision in March 2018 to accept certain classifications of Medicaid enrollees as automatically qualified for free lunches. She says the change was not caused by a sudden decline in the area’s economy. Information from: The Daily Nonpareil, http://www.nonpareilonline.com Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Summer food benefits OK’d for 530K Alabama children,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — An estimated 530,000 Alabama children who get free or reduced price school meals are now eligible for food benefits this summer after the school year ends, officials said Tuesday. The Alabama Department of Human Resources said qualifying households will get $120 for each participating student to buy food that is eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at stores that accept Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. The Summer Pandemic EBT program benefits are expected to begin rolling out in mid-to-late summer. “Inflation has transformed each grocery trip into a balancing act for low-income families struggling to afford food for their children on top of other costs like housing and transportation,” said Alabama Department of Human Resources Commissioner Nancy Buckner in a news release. “Every dollar of support from programs like P-EBT strengthens their spending power and weakens the prospect of hunger, while promoting nutritious meals for children.” Summer P-EBT benefits are limited to students who receive free or reduced price meals under the National School Lunch Program. To become eligible, families may apply by contacting their schools. Applications must be approved by May 16 to qualify for summer benefits. Households with eligible students who received P-EBT benefits previously will access Summer P-EBT benefits on their existing EBT cards. Those who are new to the National School Lunch Program will get EBT cards in the mail. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Utah Senate committee passes bill expanding school breakfast,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A proposal to expand breakfast at Utah schools for low-income kids has passed a key hurdle in a turnaround after its defeat sparked public frustration. The bill would require schools to provide students who qualify for free or reduced-price meals with alternative breakfast, such as breakfast served in classrooms, grab-and-go carts or second-chance mid-morning meals. The Economic Development and Workforce Committee passed the bill with amendments Monday, including permitting schools or districts to opt out of the program and lowering eligibility requirements. The bill will next move to the Senate for consideration. The proposal had already passed the House but failed in the Senate committee Wednesday with at least one lawmaker noting that breakfast was a family responsibility. When the amended bill was reconsidered by the committee, all three lawmakers who voted against it before switched to support. “I think it sounds like a good program, and I’m curious to see how it’s implemented,” Hinkins said, after originally opposing the legislation. The bill will be a “difference maker” for children, bill sponsor and Republican state Rep. Dan Johnson said, adding that without legislation he knows teachers who keep food in their classrooms to ensure students can focus on class without being hungry. Advocacy organization Utahns Against Hunger said in a news release that many schools offer alternative breakfast, but the state has the lowest rate of participation with fewer than 40% of all eligible students receiving breakfast, the Deseret News reported. School breakfast programs improve student health, education outcomes and general well-being, the release added. Schools that already participate in the National School Lunch Program will now be required to expand and also provide breakfast, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Cherry sausage maker will close shop in northern Michigan,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CEDAR, Mich. (AP) — A well-known family business that put cherries in sausage is closing its doors in Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula. Pleva’s Meats in Cedar in Leelanau County has been around for 73 years. General manager Andrew Pleva told the Traverse City Record-Eagle that expenses and other challenges are piling up. The meat market will close Feb. 1. “It’s an industry that’s starting to die, and it’s something that we can no longer do,” said Pleva, son of owners Tom and Connie Pleva. Tom’s cousin and a former owner, Ray Pleva, is credited with creating Plevalean, a sausage made with tart cherries. The blend was patented in 1995 and offered in school lunch programs. Andrew Pleva said the family would like to somehow keep making Plevalean. “We’d like to partner with another company that might be interested in making it with us,” he said. “It’s still kind of up in the air as far as what we’re going to do.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tennessee lawmakers are at odds after studying rejection of US education money over its requirements,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - The Tennessee Capitol is seen, Jan. 8, 2020, in Nashville, Tenn. Tennessee lawmakers will return Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024, for several months of election-year work, anchored by the debate over whether taxpayer money to help students attend private schools should be available statewide for families of any income level. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee lawmakers have hit an impasse after studying whether the state should forgo more than $1 billion in federal K-12 education money annually, due in part to Republican backlash against rules to protect LGBTQ+ people, as senators caution that the rejection would be unprecedented and raise more questions than answers. Those findings are spelled out in a letter this week from the Senate lawmakers on a joint House-Senate panel that studied the prospects of rejecting the money and replacing it with state cash. The senators wrote that they haven’t been able to agree with their House counterparts on recommendations about the federal education funding, much of which is targeted to serve low-income students, English learners and students with disabilities. A House report has not been released. Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton raised the idea of rejecting the federal education money early last year, saying the state could afford to backfill the money, estimated at as much as $1.8 billion, in an effort to avoid certain federal requirements. Some of those include LGBTQ+ protections, which Tennessee’s Republican supermajority Legislature has peeled back at the state level over the years. Sexton and GOP Senate Speaker Randy McNally set up the study committee last September, leading to several meetings that included testimony from various experts, but not from the federal government. The discussion comes as other states have flirted with rejecting federal education money, though none have gone through with it yet. The U.S. Department of Education has criticized the idea as “political posturing.”  Senators on the study panel noted that even if the state were to reject some or all of the federal education money, many federal requirements could still apply, which would likely land the state in court. And while the state probably could afford to fund the rejected amount, it would come at the expense of other potential investments. They also wrote that if Tennessee rejects the money, much of it is based on formulas and would not result in savings for federal taxpayers unless Congress reduced that amount of funding. The money would probably just go to other states, senators wrote. In Tennessee, federal education funds made up about 20% of the state’s $8.3 billion education budget for 2022-2023. The choice is also complicated by a slowdown in state revenues after high returns in recent years. The senators detailed several other options, such as seeking a waiver to lift certain requirements, working with congressional members to change laws, requiring approval of lawmakers before a state agency can apply for a federal grant, and looping in lawmakers when the federal agency communicates with the state. “There are more questions than definitive answers about what rejecting federal K-12 dollars could mean for Tennessee’s obligations because no state has ever done so,” according to the Senate report, signed by four Republicans and one Democrat on the joint committee. Sexton’s office said the House will file its own report. It’s unclear what kind of proposals might surface out of the study during the legislative session that began this week. In an interview this week before the Senate released its report, Sexton said that “at some point in the future,” lawmakers may move to reject federal education funding and replace it with state money. He said he expects lawmakers this session to parse through the different state and federal rules and testing requirements and their purposes, and ask that lawmakers get to regularly see the letters sent from federal education to the state. Sexton mentioned concerns about the federal rules surrounding school lunch programs. He also expressed concerns about President Joe Biden’s administration proposing protections for transgender athletes. At least 20 states — including Tennessee — have approved a version of a blanket ban on transgender athletes playing on K-12 and collegiate sports teams statewide, but the Biden administration proposal to forbid such outright bans is set to be finalized in March after two delays and much pushback. As proposed, the rule, announced in April, would establish that blanket bans would violate Title IX, the landmark gender-equity legislation enacted in 1972. “What Biden is trying to do is inject that men can play women’s sports in Title IX,” Sexton said. “We just passed a law that says we don’t allow that in Tennessee. But if he puts it in Title IX, because he’ll never get it passed in Congress, it trumps state law and goes against what we believe should be the case in Tennessee.” Tennessee is currently among 10 states that have long refused to expand Medicaid to thousands of low-income residents, many of whom can’t afford health coverage. And several years ago, many Republican-led states declined to keep accepting federal money for extra unemployment insurance payouts later in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bill aims to have more students eating school breakfasts,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOSTON (AP) — A push to expand school breakfast programs in Massachusetts is making its way through the Legislature. The Massachusetts Senate this week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60 percent or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40% compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need. The schools could use different options to offer breakfast after the tardy bell, including breakfast in the classroom, grab-and-go, and second-chance breakfast. The federally reimbursed Breakfast After the Bell program could provide up to $30 million statewide to school districts that increase participation rates to 80 percent and more. The House has approved its own version of the bill. The two chambers will now work to come up with a single compromise bill to send to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker.

Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday signed legislation to provide free school meals to all students regardless of family income, as New Mexico and several other states look to fill the gap left by lapsed federal pandemic-era benefit programs and address the strain to family budgets caused by food prices. The bill cleared the Legislature during the recent 60-day session, with lawmakers setting aside more than $22 million in the state budget to help pay for the program. Additional money will be used to improve school kitchens so healthier meals can be prepared. “When we feed our children, we’re feeding our future – these investments today will yield benefits tomorrow through generations of healthier New Mexicans,” the Democratic governor said in a statement issued after she celebrated with dozens of elementary school students. California and Maine have made universal meals permanent, legislation to do so is advancing in Vermont, and Nevada pitched in $75 million to extend free school meals for this school year. In Colorado, voters approved a ballot measure last fall giving school districts the opportunity to offer free lunches. Nationally, debts for unpaid school meals have been rising, indicating the need to continue providing free meals to ensure students are able to concentrate in the classroom. A recent report issued by the Food Research & Action Center showed participation in school breakfast and lunch programs was higher during the last school year than that of pre-pandemic levels.  About 67% — or 309,000 New Mexico students — are eligible to receive free and reduced-price lunches through the National School Lunch Program, according to the New Mexico Public Education Department. Signing of the legislation could impact nearly 70,000 students who normally would have had to pay for school meals, with department officials expecting a 5% to 10% increase in participation in districts that operate national school lunch programs. Lujan Grisham included the proposal in her State of the State address, saying that wherever kids are, there ought to be a kitchen working to keep them healthy, strong and ready to learn. Still, some say more money will be needed to bankroll the effort over time. This year, New Mexico was awash in new revenue due in part to a financial windfall from oil production. Legislative analysts have estimated that providing meals at no costs to students at participating schools could total between $27 million and $40 million in recurring funding from the state’s general fund. Advocacy groups see universal free school meals as the next step in New Mexico’s march toward combating historically high food insecurity rates in a state that has long struggled with generational poverty. Other recent efforts include legislation in 2020 that eliminated student co-pays for reduced-price school meals and a 2017 measure that made New Mexico the first state in the U.S. to ensure children can’t be humiliated by school meal debts. The new law aims to boost the amount of food that comes from local growers through farm-to-table grants. Currently, about 168 farmers, ranchers and food businesses sell locally produced products to schools in 19 of the state’s 33 counties. Supporters also hope the new law will lead to less food waste by requiring kindergarten through sixth grade students to have more time to sit down and eat, and by collecting unused food for use by food pantries, students and other charitable organizations.

Federal program to give Cape Girardeau district free meals,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) — A program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture will provide students in the Cape Girardeau school district with free meals for four years. The Southeast Missourian reports that the school district recently announced it’ll receive more than $1.5 million in assistance through the Community Eligibility Provision. The program will serve the district’s 4,000 students with free breakfasts and lunches. Josh Crowell is assistant superintendent of support services for the district. Crowell says the district qualified for the program because 40 percent of students are living at or below the poverty line. Blanchard Elementary Principal Barbara Kohlfeld says families in the past had to fill out applications to qualify for free lunch based on income level and other factors. Crowell says he hopes the program ends the stigma around free food. Information from: Southeast Missourian, http://www.semissourian.com Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"Food insecurity shot up last year with inflation and the end of pandemic-era aid, a new report says","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - Second-grade students select their meals during lunch break in the cafeteria, Dec. 12, 2022, at an elementary school in Scottsdale, Ariz. More students in schools serving low-income communities will be eligible to receive breakfast and lunch at no cost under a rule change announced Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (AP Photo/Alberto Mariani, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — An estimated 17 million households reported problems finding enough food in 2022 — a sharp jump from 2021 when boosted government aid helped ease the pandemic-induced economic shutdown. A new Department of Agriculture report, released Wednesday, paints a sobering picture of post-pandemic hardship with “statistically significant” increases in food insecurity across multiple categories. Using a representative survey sample of roughly 32,000 American households the report said 12.8% (17 million households) reported occasional problems affording enough food in 2022 — up from 10.2% (13.5 million households) in 2021 and 10.5% (13.8 million households) in 2020. Analysts and food security professionals point to the dual impact last year of high inflation and the gradual expiration of multiple pandemic-era government assistance measures. “This underscores how the unwinding of the pandemic interventions and the rising costs of food has taken hold,” said Geri Henchy, director of nutrition policy for the Food Research and Action Center. “It’s like a horrible storm for families.” The number of households reporting more serious forms of economic hardship also increased. Wednesday’s report by the USDA’s Economic Research Service also tracks families with “very low food security” — a condition it defines as families having to ration food consumption and where “normal eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year because of limited resources.” Households experiencing this level of hardship in 2022 rose to 5.1% (6.8 million households), up from 3.8% (5.1 million households) in 2021 and 3.9% (5.1 million households) in 2020.   Increased benefits and more relaxed enrollment rules for SNAP — the foundational government assistance program commonly known as food stamps — didn’t end until early this year. But a host of other federal and state-level pandemic aid initiatives wound down last year. One key national change that Henchy highlighted was the end of universal free school lunches for all students, a policy that ended over the summer of 2022. “These were healthy, nutritious meals because the schools had good standards,” she said. “It was great for the kids. It was stigma-free, and it was huge for people’s budgets.” These findings broadly mirror real-time anecdotes from late last year, when multiple food banks and charitable groups reported being surprised by the higher-than-expected levels of need entering the 2022 holiday season. In several cases last year, food banks and charities made educated estimates of how much food they would need to distribute, only to find that those predictions were far too low. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack called the survey results “unacceptable” and said the rising level of need “should be a wake-up call to those wanting to further roll back our anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs.” Vilsack highlighted the increased fruit and vegetable benefits for recipients of WIC — an aid program that specifically targets mothers and young children. The increased WIC benefits package is one of the few pandemic policies that’s continuing, although there have been proposals in Congress to bring those benefits down to pre-pandemic levels. “The experience of the pandemic showed us that when government invests in meaningful support for families, we can make a positive impact on food security, even during challenging economic times,” Vilsack said in a statement Wednesday. “No child should go hungry in America. The report is a stark reminder of the consequences of shrinking our proven safety net.” President Joe Biden’s White House echoed Vilsack’s call to maintain WIC funding at its current levels and strengthen the country’s social safety net in multiple ways. White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said: “17 million households experiencing food insecurity in the richest nation in the world is unacceptable, and exactly why President Biden has continued to call on Congress to fund programs like WIC, as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the National School Lunch Program, and restore the enhanced Child Tax Credit that helped cut child poverty in half and helped millions of families afford the basics.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

More students gain eligibility for free school meals under expanded US program,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - Second-grade students select their meals during lunch break in the cafeteria, Dec. 12, 2022, at an elementary school in Scottsdale, Ariz. More students in schools serving low-income communities will be eligible to receive breakfast and lunch at no cost under a rule change announced Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (AP Photo/Alberto Mariani, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Millions of additional students in schools serving low-income communities will be eligible to receive breakfast and lunch at no cost under a rule change announced Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At schools where 25% of families participate in income-based public benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, the federal government now will cover the cost of free meals for all enrolled students. Previously, the qualifying threshold was 40%. Roughly 3,000 additional school districts serving more than 5 million students will now be eligible, officials said. “While there is still more work ahead to ensure every K-12 student in the nation can access healthy school meals at no cost, this is a significant step on the pathway toward that goal,” said Stacy Dean, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. During the pandemic, Congress temporarily made universal meals free to all students, but that ended last year. Other federal programs that provided direct food assistance to families also scaled down amid soaring food prices, putting strains on family budgets and leaving some kids hungry. Meantime, eight states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont — have made school meals free to all students regardless of income. The new rule will expand access to universal meals through a program known as the Community Eligibility Provision, or CEP. Instead of requiring families to fill out individual applications for free or reduced-price meals, schools participating in the program receive federal funding based on income data, with local or state money filling in any gaps in the cost of offering meals to all students. Advocates say reducing administrative burdens like applications helps ensure children don’t go hungry.  Some have criticized the costs of the program. The Republican Study Committee has called for eliminating the CEP altogether, arguing it ignores the individual income eligibility of each student. Nationally, expanding a community-based model of universal meals would alleviate burdens on many families, said Anna Korsen, policy and program director at Full Plates Full Potential, a nonprofit organization in Maine that works on maximizing access to school meals. “The federal poverty guidelines that dictate who gets a free meal and who doesn’t are really outdated,” Korsen said. “There are so many families that on paper don’t qualify for a free meal, and they can get lumped into this group of ... families that can afford to pay for lunch or breakfast at school. But really, those families are living paycheck to paycheck.” Agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack said the rule change is a step toward fulfilling the promise of healthy school meals for all. “Increasing access to free, healthy school breakfast and lunch will decrease childhood hunger, improve child health and student readiness, and put our nation on the path to better nutrition and wellness,” he said.

(Kenneth Ferriera/Lincoln Journal Star via AP) Lower-income families with school-age kids can get help from the federal government paying for groceries this summer, unless they live in one of the 14 states that have said no to joining the program this year.  The reasons for the rejections, all from states with Republican governors, include philosophical objections to welfare programs, technical challenges due to aging computer systems and satisfaction with other summer nutrition programs reaching far fewer children.  The impact falls on people like Otibehia Allen, a single mom of five in Clarksdale, Mississippi, who makes too much to qualify for some public assistance programs. She could have received $480 in aid over three months this summer if her state participated.  “It would have helped us a whole lot, especially with the boys,” Allen said. “They’re growing children. They eat a lot.”   Many states have rejected federal funds on principle or for technical reasons. In 2021, 26 states cut short the enhanced unemployment benefits people received during the coronavirus pandemic. Twenty-two states have turned down the mostly federally funded expansion of Medicaid eligibility to provide health insurance to more lower-income adults. A dozen of those states have reconsidered and expanded Medicaid.   The Summer EBT program, a response to increased child hunger when school is out, involves much less money. The federal government launched pilot versions in 2011, expanded it nationally during the pandemic and then Congress made it permanent within a spending bill adopted in December 2022. States must split the administrative costs 50/50, and the federal government funds the benefits, which are expected to cost $2.5 billion this year and help feed 21 million children.  Another 10 million eligible kids live in states that turned down the funding.  For each of three summer months, families with children in free or reduced-price school lunch programs will get $40 per qualifying child on an electronic benefits transfer — or EBT — card. It can only cover groceries and food from farmers’ markets.  Family size determines the income limits. A family of three making under about $46,000 would qualify in most of the country.  States had until the end of 2023 to decide whether they would join this summer. They can enroll in future years even if they skip it in 2024. Vermont plans to do that after replacing a state computer system.  The spending measure provided some broad outlines a year earlier and the U.S. Department of Agriculture shared details with the states throughout 2023. But the interim final rules were not published until Dec. 29, timing that some states said proved problematic for deciding whether to join.  The Texas Health and Human Services Commission said late rulemaking factored into its opting out, along with needing lawmakers to approve funding for the state’s administrative cost share. Texas lawmakers aren’t scheduled to convene this year. Spokesperson Thomas Vazquez said via email that Texas would consider joining later.  It’s the other way around in Tennessee, which opted into the lunch program for 2024 but doesn’t plan to continue in 2025.  Like leaders in other states, Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s office said the initiative is a pandemic-era benefit and that other food programs already exist.  But Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group targeting hunger, has found that the main federally funded summer nutrition program doesn’t reach most qualified children. During the summer of 2022, it fed only one of every nine children served by the free or reduced-price lunch program nationwide during the 2021-2022 school year.  Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder said she turned down the Summer EBT card funds because she wanted to prioritize the current summer meals programs, which require minimal state funding.  “I generally prefer those meals getting directly to kids,” she told The Associated Press. “At the feeding sites, we know that’s happening.”  Still, she said the summer sites in her rural state need improvement. In 2022, they served about 9,400 summer lunches daily, which is only one-fifth of the daily average for free and reduced price lunches in the 2021-22 school year. Six of Wyoming’s 23 counties have no sites. And even though the federal government last year started letting families take home a week’s worth of meals for children, Wyoming sites offered only in-person meals.  Wyoming’s share of administrative costs this year would have been about $1.1 million, and about $690,000 annually in the future, Defenfelder said.  Republican governors currently lead all the rejecting states, but Louisiana had a Democrat with one week left in his term when the deadline hit.  In some places, the rejections have had a partisan edge.  In Mississippi, one of the states with the most food insecurity for children, some 324,000 children — including four of Allen’s — would have been eligible.  Republican Gov. Tate Reeves’ office declared it an unnecessary big government program, saying that if Washington D.C. Democrats had their way, “Americans would still be locked down, subjected to COVID vaccine and mask mandates, and welfare rolls would’ve exploded.”  Allen, who works as a transportation dispatcher and scheduler, thinks Reeves’ priorities are misplaced. She pointed to the state’s implementation of an abortion ban in 2022.  “Why do you care so much about my uterus and how many babies I’m having or aborting?” Allen said. “Why is that a concern when I still have to feed this child, but you’re not helping me do that?”  The rejections have drawn backlash.  In Nebraska, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen sparked a firestorm of criticism when he justified rejecting the money by explaining, “I don’t believe in welfare.” But he reversed course on Monday and said the state would join the program after a Democratic lawmaker introduced a bill to require participation. He said he was swayed by hearing stories about hunger from high school students.  Lisa Davis, senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry Campaign for Share Our Strength, said she believes all the states can be persuaded to join in the coming years.  “Childhood hunger is one of the few issues that brings everyone together,” she said.  The remaining holdouts are Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wyoming.  Officials in Iowa’s two most populous counties are requesting the state-rejected funds anyway, though the program offers no pathway to fund local governments instead of states.  In Iowa’s rejection, Gov. Kim Reynolds said it was not a long-term solution.  “An EBT card does nothing to promote nutrition at a time when childhood obesity has become an epidemic,” the Republican said in a statement.  But Crystal FitzSimons, director of school programs at Food Research and Action Center, cited research that families buy more nutritional food when their grocery subsidies increase.  “It’s a missed opportunity when kids are going hungry,” she said.

Students in Florida school district to get free meals,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BROOKSVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Thanks to Hurricane Irma, all students in one Florida school system will qualify for free breakfast and lunch through 2022. The Tampa Bay Times reports the federal Community Eligibility Provision program that offers meal assistance in low-income areas covered 17 of Hernando County’s 25 schools last year. But because the area was deemed a disaster area after the 2017 storm, all schools there will now qualify for the free program. And that’s regardless of students’ individual economic needs. School district food and nutrition services director Lori Drenth says after Irma the county’s households qualified for the a short-term assistance program. Those enrollment numbers led to a spike in the percentage of students getting free meals. She said the “artificially high” count allowed the district to offer free meals to everyone.

Lynn Public School program offers free meals to all students,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. LYNN, Mass. (AP) — After more than three months into a new program that allows Lynn Public Schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students, regardless of income status, results show there has been an increase in the number of kids who eat at school. Over the summer, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) approved a request from school administrative officials to enter into the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Program, part of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. The program is aimed at ensuring no kids go hungry and reduces the stigma of low-income families who may have otherwise had to apply for free meals. All students can receive a free breakfast and lunch, regardless of their status. “Now taking away the stigma of someone having to put a number in or somehow maybe having to identify themselves is gone, so now more kids are eating the lunches and breakfast than ever before,” said School Business Administrator Kevin McHugh. “I don’t have proof, but it’s good to see at that level, we saw a good-sized bump.” Results nearly halfway into the school year show that the amount of students eating breakfast and lunch district-wide has increased an average of 7 percent. Results are higher at the high school level, where students were shown to be more interested in lunch, according to McHugh. The state predicted school districts would see an increase of 5 to 9 percent with the program. In October, results showed 81 percent of all students in the district took a lunch, but McHugh hopes to inch that figure closer to 90 percent.  School Committee member Brian Castellanos said offering free meals at school is essential — through his work as a social worker, he sees families who rely on those meals, because their kids may not get anything to eat at home. “Some kids, this is sometimes all they’re going to eat and they’ll wait for the next meal the next day,” he said. “I think that Lynn is going to be a pioneer on a lot of the way we’re going to go about how we increase equity (in) food.” School Committee member Lorraine Gately said from her years as a teacher, it was clear that test scores align with nutrition. “When a student is fed and has a good, solid meal in their stomach they do well. They do better on testing,” she said. Much of the ongoing effort and challenge, McHugh said, has been on increasing the quality of the food offered at the schools, while still adhering to stringent nutritional guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Efforts are being made to retool what menu items are offered at schools in an attempt to offer food the kids like. Student surveys have been conducted to see what the kids are responding favorably to. “We want to meet all the guidelines, but we want the students to take the meals and consume the meals,” said McHugh. “I want them to eat the meals. That’s the success of the program, not just taking the meal and getting a reimbursement. Ultimately, if they eat it, they’re going to get the nutritional value as well.” In addition to menu changes, the district is piloting several new programs, including two with the New England Dairy Council to offer breakfast smoothies at Thurgood Marshall Middle School and a health and fitness program, Play 60 Program, for students at Ingalls and Drewicz Elementary schools. Thanks to a collaboration with One Mighty Mill, fresh bagels will soon be offered at Lynn English High School. What prompted school administrative officials to look into improving the quality of food in the district was a group of Lynn mothers who appeared before the School Committee in April to demand Lynn Public Schools provide better food to their children. Madres de Lynn, a Latino parents group founded by the North Shore Labor Council’s Women’s Committee, said the kids were coming home hungry and that food was being thrown out because they wouldn’t eat it. They reported expired milk and juice and chicken that tasted like plastic. Administrative officials are working with the group to continue to make improvements to the menu. School Committee vice-chair Donna Coppola, one of the driving forces behind the effort to offer free meals, said the Madres were able to push the needle in a way she couldn’t and shows parents they do have a voice and it’s important for officials to hear from them. When McHugh applied for the CEP program last spring, it was the first time it was economically feasible for the school department to send an application to DESE. In the past, it had been cost prohibitive. DESE only counts students in the district who are “direct certified,” which means they were receiving assistance and listed on the state’s database. Over the past two years, the school administration has worked to increase the district’s direct certified students by comparing its student database against the state databases. That resulted in an increase of the district’s direct certified rate from 51 percent to 58.4 percent at the time it applied for the CEP program, which allows the Lynn Public Schools to receive a net profit of approximately $100,000 annually. To qualify for the program, a school district must have a direct certified rate of at least 40 percent. Online: https://bit.ly/2SUfGVo Information from: The (Lynn, Mass.)

America got older last decade. The share of seniors age 65 or older in the U.S. grew by more than a third, while the share of children declined, particularly among those under age 5, according to new figures from the 2020 census released Thursday, May 25, 2023. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) The head count of every U.S. resident in 2020 helped guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in annual federal spending, underscoring the importance of participating in the once-a-decade census, according to a new report released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau. There were 353 federal assistance programs that used the Census Bureau data in 2021 to steer the allocation of the federal funding, up from 316 programs accounting for $1.5 trillion in 2017, the time frame for the last update of a similar study. The federal funding is distributed to state and local governments, nonprofits, businesses and households. In 2021, it helped pay for health care, education, school lunch programs, COVID-19 relief, child care, food assistance programs and highway construction, among other things. “It almost doubled and makes it even more clear the importance of census data in evidence-based policy making and having a healthy economy,” said George Washington University research professor Andrew Reamer, who helped put together the report. The Census Bureau, which conducts the U.S. censuses every 10 years, doesn’t determine how the federal funding is distributed. The increase in federal funding over four years is due to COVID-19 relief spending, as well as boosts in payments for Medicare — which provides federal health insurance for people age 65 and over — as more baby boomers in the U.S. became senior citizens, said Allison Plyer, chief demographer at The Data Center in New Orleans.  “Congress decided that federal funding should be distributed based on data,” Plyer said. COVID-19 relief funds accounted for a quarter of the federal spending allocated with census figures’ help in 2021 — or more than $700 billion. “COVID-19, ... it was never predicted but our data was the first line of defense in order to get funding to states,” said Ceci Villa Ross, a Census Bureau official who wrote the report. The breadth of the programs and the amount of money at stake demonstrate how some communities can miss out on funding opportunities if they aren’t counted. The 2020 census was among the most difficult in recent memory because of obstacles posed by the spread of COVID-19, which in the U.S. coincided with the head count. Adding to the difficulties were hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, wildfires in the West and unsuccessful efforts by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the census questionnaire, which critics say may have scared off immigrants and others. Black, Hispanic and American Indian residents were missed at higher rates in the 2020 census than they were in the 2010 census, with the undercount 3.3% for the Black population, almost 5% for Hispanics and 5.6% for American Indians and Native Alaskans living on reservations. Additionally, six states had undercounts: Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. In an effort to make sure communities get their fair share of money despite the undercounts, the Census Bureau has incorporated other data sources, in addition to the numbers from the 2020 census, to calculate population estimates which are updated each year between censuses and also used for helping determine federal funding. Besides helping guide the distribution of federal funding, figures from the census determine how many congressional seats each state gets and are used for redrawing political districts.

NY to invest $1.5M in ‘farm-to-school’ lunch programs,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state will invest $1.5 million in additional funds in efforts to bring fresh, locally grown farm products to public schools in the coming school year. School districts can apply for grants of up to $100,000 each that can support the hiring of a program coordinator, staff training or the purchase of equipment to store, prepare or transport farm products. Since the state’s “farm-to-school” program began in 2015 the state has set aside more than $1.8 million to help programs in 164 school districts across the state. State officials announced the funding on Thursday. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the program benefits students by providing them with fresh fruits, vegetables and other products while also helping create markets for the state’s farmers.

Summer feeding benefit going to WVa households for children,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Eligible West Virginia households will receive a one-time summer feeding benefit for children, the state Department of Education said. The program will provide $391 per eligible child to be deposited onto the child’s West Virginia-Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer card, the department said. The funds can be expected during August. The state estimates the funding will go to approximately 255,000 children, representing nearly $100 million in additional federal funding, the department said in a news release. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state Education Department and the state Health and Human Resources Department. Eligible students are those enrolled during the last school year in a school that participates in the National School Lunch Program and qualifies for free or reduced-price meals. Eligible children not yet enrolled in school are those who are younger than 6 and live in a household that receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. Families of children who have experienced a change in status that could deem them eligible should reach out to their county or school child nutrition contact to apply before July 31, the release said. More information is available online. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-us-department-of-agriculture-43077c1d66b0e82875468be571d64c88
Egypt suspends school lunches after mass food poisoning,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CAIRO (AP) — An outbreak of food poisoning has sickened thousands of Egyptian schoolchildren this month, figures showed Thursday, sending parents rushing to hospitals and leading the Education Ministry to temporarily suspend its school lunch program. Egypt saw 4,650 suspected food poisoning cases in schools nationwide in March alone, the Cabinet said in a statement carried by state-run news agency MENA, compared to some 300 cases previously reported since the beginning of the academic year in September. In a single incident last week in the southern city of Sohag, at least 3,353 students were affected. Similar outbreaks have taken place this week in other governorates, though on a much smaller scale, including in the canal city of Suez, Menoufiya in the Nile Delta and the southern city of Aswan. The Education Ministry suspended the distribution of school meals nationwide as of Thursday, saying late Wednesday that a committee will be formed to “find out the reasons behind these occurrences ... and conduct required investigations.” School meals are provided to around nine million students in Egypt daily. Sobhi Abdelrahman, the nutrition director at the Education Ministry, told The Associated Press that “the suspension decision covers all the meals that might have caused the problem.” “We are waiting on the findings of the public prosecution, who is investigating the case,” he added, affirming that meals undergo “thorough examination” by authorities prior to distribution. Health Minister Tarek Shawki described the suspension as a “precautionary” measure in a televised interview with a local TV station. In a press conference Thursday, Health Ministry official Amr Kandil said an investigation of school meals had detected no microbes linked to food poisoning. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Florida to schools: Don’t follow federal LGBTQ protections,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida advised school districts to ignore protections for LGBTQ students that President Joe Biden’s administration is trying to implement, saying the anti-discrimination language is not binding law and following the guidance could result in breaking state law. Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz wrote to school districts Thursday saying they should not change current practices because of proposed new rules under Title IX that would extend sexual discrimination protections to students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. “Nothing in these guidance documents requires you to give biological males who identify as female access to female bathrooms, locker rooms, or dorms ... or to allow biological males who identify as female to compete on female sports teams,” Diaz said. He added that doing any of those things would “jeopardize the safety and wellbeing of Florida students and risk violating Florida law.” But Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat and whose agency overseas school lunch programs, said the matter wasn’t just about bathrooms, but also about feeding students. The United States Department of Agriculture requires schools to put up a poster on nondiscrimination in order to receive federal money for lunch programs, she said. “This is a fictitious culture war that they have created that is going to deny kids food,” Fried, who hopes to challenge Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, said at a news conference. “I will do everything possible to ensure that Florida’s kids are not victimized by the DeSantis administration and denied their meals.”  Fried’s department recently told schools they should hang posters with the new language. The Diaz letter told schools to disregard that guidance because it could violate state law. Last year, DeSantis signed a bill banning anyone assigned male at birth from participating in girls’ or women’s sports. This year, he signed a bill that prohibits discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation in public schools at least through grade 3. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Tennessee blocked implementation of the proposed new federal protections after 20 states sued over the issue. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

WVa looking for partners to help feed kids during summer,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — The state of West Virginia is looking to partner with local government agencies, nonprofits and other organizations to help run a program to feed kids over the summer. Through the Department of Education’s “Summer Food Service Program,” children who usually receive meals at school through the School Breakfast Program or National School Lunch Program can access food at sites like schools, churches, community centers, pools, parks, libraries, housing complexes and summer camps. Summer months can pose a challenge for families in need of food while school isn’t in session, state Superintendent of Schools W. Clayton Burch said in a news release. “Supporting these sites in your community is one of the most important things you can do to ensure all children have uninterrupted access to nutritious meals this summer,” he said. An average of 202,273 children in West Virginia — about 78% of schoolchildren — depend on free and reduced-price meals at school, according to the state Department of Education. Organizations interested in becoming a 2022 summer sponsor can contact Cybele Boehm or Samantha Reeves with the Department of Education’s Office of Child Nutrition. They can be reached at [email protected] or [email protected] or (833) 627-2833. Summer sites will be announced in June. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Republican AGs sue US agency over LGBTQ school guidance,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — More than 20 Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit Tuesday against President Joe Biden’s administration over a Department of Agriculture school meal program that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The challenge, led by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, claims that the federal government is attempting to force states and schools to follow antidiscrimination requirements that “misconstrue the law.” The coalition of attorneys general are hoping for a similar result to a separate challenge from earlier this month when a Tennessee judge temporarily barred two federal agencies from enforcing directives issued by Biden’s administration that extended protections for LGBTQ people in schools and workplaces. The judge sided with the attorneys general, ruling that the directives infringed on states’ right to enact laws, such as banning students from participating in sports based on their gender identity or requiring schools and businesses to provide bathrooms and showers to accommodate transgender people. “This case is, yet again, about a federal agency trying to change law, which is Congress’ exclusive prerogative,” Slatery said in a statement. “The USDA simply does not have that authority. We have successfully challenged the Biden Administration’s other attempts to rewrite law and we will challenge this as well.” In May, the USDA announced that it would include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as a violation of Title IX, the sweeping 1972 law that guarantees equity between the sexes in “any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The directive requires states to review allegations of discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, as well as update their policies and signage.  The agency warned that states and schools that receive federal funds, which include the national school lunch program overseen by the USDA, have agreed to follow civil rights laws. Although the agency says it wants voluntary compliance, it also has promised to refer violations to the Department of Justice. It is not clear whether the federal government would hold back funding for school meal programs as part of its enforcement. The directive followed a landmark civil rights decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020 that, under a provision called Title VII, protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in the workplace. According to the lawsuit, the attorneys general allege that the USDA’s new directive is based on a “misreading” of the Supreme Court’s ruling and did not provide states and other groups the opportunity to provide public comment. The attorneys general involved in the lawsuit filed Tuesday are from Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia. A spokesperson for the USDA did not immediately return a request for comment. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Coalition launched to provide school lunches to global needy,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Over 60 governments and 50 U.N. agencies and organizations have joined forces to press for the restoration of school lunches for all 388 million primary school children who were receiving the meals before the COVID-19 pandemic. They also will push for school meals to be started for 73 million vulnerable youngsters who weren’t getting them before the coronavirus struck in early 2020. Led by France and Finland, the School Meals Coalition was officially launched at a U.N. event Tuesday with a longer-term goal of ensuring that every needy child in the world gets a nutritious school meal by 2030. Finland’s U.N. ambassador, Jukka Salovaara, called school meals “a great social equalizer,” saying they “can really act as a social safety net within communities.” Since the coalition was formed in September, he said, the support has been very encouraging, but “as the goal of the coalition is to reach all children by 2030 ... we have to have a very broad participation.” The French Mission’s development expert, Olivier Richard, told reporters that “school meals are very important for the recovery of our society from the impact of COVID 19” because they “keep the children at school, and they improve their nutrition, their health and educational performing.” Richard said he doesn’t think the coalition will get support from every country, which is why the U.N. agencies that operate globally are such important members.  In a joint declaration late Tuesday, five U.N. agencies threw their support behind the coalition’s campaign, saying school health and nutrition programs support the growth and development of school children and adolescents and “can help to combat child poverty, hunger and malnutrition in all its forms.” “They attract children to school and support children’s learning, and long-term health and well-being,” said the declaration signed by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the U.N. Children’s Fund, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. According to the coalition, the 388 million students receiving lunch before the pandemic represented one out of every two primary school children worldwide. Carmen Burbano, director of the World Food Program’s school-based programs, told reporters that by May 2020, 370 million of those children had lost access to the meals because schools closed, “so basically, all of these programs collapsed.” “At the moment, our recent information is that 238 million children have resumed having access to these programs,” she said. “We calculate that there are still 150 million children that do not have access to those programs at the moment, mainly because schools continue to be closed in large parts of the world.” Burbano said the 73 million children who weren’t getting meals before the pandemic are in 60 low income and lower middle income countries living in extreme poverty — 80% of them in Africa. Before COVID-19, she said, governments were spending between $40 billion and $50 billion annually from domestic budgets on school lunch programs, so the coalition’s first goal is calling on leaders to restore what they were doing before the pandemic. Burbano said $4.7 billion would be needed to reach the 73 million children “that were falling through the cracks.” She said estimates were that $3 billion would come from domestic budgets and $1.7 billion from donors to help very fragile countries in Africa’s Sahel region and the Horn of Africa as well as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and other countries that can’t afford school lunch programs now. The coalition is appealing for the $1.7 billion, and additional funding to reach the 2030 goal. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Wyoming fundraising to erase school lunch debt in state,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — More than 3,000 Wyoming youngsters will have their school lunch debt forgiven through a fundraising effort coordinated by First Lady Jennie Gordon and others. The effort raised almost $99,500 to forgive unpaid school lunch money owed by 3,224 schoolchildren in Wyoming, Gordon’s office announced Wednesday. “This partnership ensures that our schoolchildren and their families will have one less thing to worry about in the future and can focus on learning,” Gordon said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the National School Lunch Program, has been covering school lunch costs for all students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The money raised will cover unpaid lunch money in Wyoming from before the pandemic. Debt to be covered in 28 of Wyoming’s 48 school districts ranges from less than $1 to over $11,800 in Sheridan County School District No. 2 and $46,600 in Albany County School District No. 1. Gordon’s Wyoming Hunger Initiative worked with the Mountain West Credit Union Foundation and a Dubois couple to raise much of the money. The foundation, through credit unions around Wyoming, raised $40,000. National Military Vehicle Museum founder Dan Starks and his wife Cynthia, of Dubois, matched that amount. Other donations came from the Ellbogen Foundation and individuals including Gov. Mark Gordon. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Milwaukee suburban school won’t offer students free lunch,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. MILWAUKEE (AP) — A suburban Milwaukee school district is meeting to possibly reconsider opting out of a federally funded free meal program, a move that met with widespread criticism from parents after school board members said they were concerned participating students would “become spoiled.” The Waukesha school board planned a special meeting Monday to discuss its participation in the program. The meeting comes after parents and other advocates put pressure on the board to reconsider. The Alliance for Education in Waukesha held a rally outside the district office on Friday to call for reinstating the program. Administrators opted into the supplemental program last year during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the school board has decided to end it, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. “As we get back to whatever you want to believe normal means, we have decisions to make,” Joseph Como, president of the school board, said in a meeting. “I would say this is part of normalization.” Board member Karin Rajnicek said the free program made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Waukesha students from low-income families will still be able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program.  In addition, as was practice before the pandemic, young students in grades lower than high school who come to school without a packed lunch, money or an accepted lunch program application, may be given cheaper meals of cheese sandwiches, finance director Sheri Stack said. “Essentially we’re going back to the pre-COVID times,” Como said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more COVID-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside. The decision also allowed students to be fed regardless of their ability to pay, qualify, convince their parents to fill out forms, or withstand stigma associated with qualifying. Sherrie Tussler, executive director of Hunger Task Force, said the program is vital for ensuring access to food. All districts that participate in the National School Lunch Program were eligible to extend the Seamless Summer Option. Of the 97% of Wisconsin school districts that were eligible, Waukesha is the only one to opt out of the extension this school year, according to the state Department of Public Instruction. Waukesha School Board Treasurer Patrick McCaffery said in a meeting he had not been aware that all school meals were being provided for free. He said he was confident that students who couldn’t afford meals would be able to qualify under the traditional program. “Our administrative team has never let a large amount of kids fall between the cracks and it’s not going to happen next year,” McCaffery said. “I think anyone that’s concerned about it, their concerns are not needed.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

AP Exclusive: Ukraine children eat food tainted by Chernobyl,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ZALYSHANY, Ukraine (AP) — Viktoria Vetrova knows the risk her four children take in drinking milk from the family’s two cows and eating dried mushrooms and berries from the forest. But the cash-strapped Ukrainian government canceled the local school lunch program for 350,000 children last year — the only source of clean food in this village near Chernobyl. So rural families are resorting to milk and produce from land still contaminated by fallout from the world’s worst nuclear accident three decades ago. Vetrova’s 8-year-old son Bogdan suffers from an enlarged thyroid, a condition which studies have linked to radioactivity. “We are aware of the dangers, but what can we do?” said Vetrova, standing in her kitchen after pouring a glass of milk. “There is no other way to survive.” Vetrova’s family and thousands of others are caught between the consequences of two disasters: the residue from Chernobyl and the recent plunge of Ukraine’s economy. After the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire, the most heavily affected areas in Ukraine were classified into four zones. Residents from three of them were evacuated or allowed to volunteer for resettlement. But the village of Zalyshany, 53 kilometers (32 miles) southwest of the destroyed reactor, is in the fourth zone — not contaminated enough for resettlement but eligible for subsidies to help with health issues. Ukraine’s Institute of Agricultural Radiology says the most recent testing in the zone showed radiation levels in wild-grown food such as nuts, berries and mushrooms were two to five times higher than what is considered safe.  However, Ukraine’s economy has since been weakened by separatist war in its eastern industrial heartland, endemic corruption and the loss of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia. Last year, the Ukrainian government, which is propped up by billions of dollars in loans from the United States, the European Union and the World Bank, cut off paying for school lunches in Zone 4. There are no official cost figures, but a typical price of about 20 hryvnia (80 U.S. cents) would put the program’s funding at about $50 million a year. “Hot meals in the schools were the only clean food, which was tested for radiation, for the children,” teacher Natalya Stepanchuk said. “Now the children have gone over to the local food, over which there is absolutely no control.” In 2012, the government halted the monitoring of radioactive contamination of food and soil in Zone 4, which was called the “zone of strict radio-ecological control.” The state has also cancelled a program for buying Ferocin, known as Prussian Blue, a substance farmers could give their cattle to hasten the elimination of the cesium-137 isotope. Without financial help, farmers in the area are unwilling to buy it on their own. “The government spends huge funds for the treatment of the local population, but cannot put out a little money on prevention,” said Valery Kashparov, head of the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology. “I am ashamed to look people in the eye.” In the view of Vitaly Petruk, head of the agency that administers the “exclusion zones” closest to the Chernobyl plant, the decision on the school lunches came down to how best to use limited funds. “What is better: to give all the money to people who have radiation sickness and save them, or split the money ... and give each of them four hryvnia (15 cents)?” he asked. “The idea was to focus on certain things, rather than dissipate energy and waste money.” This calculation means that many in the village of about 350 people go without food. And beyond Zalyshany, there are some 1,300 settlements in the zone where the lunches were cancelled. Even when the lunches were available, children were likely eating contaminated food when out of school. Nine-year-old Olesya Petrova’s mother is sick with cancer and can no longer work. Olesya hungrily awaits the coming of warm weather, when she can scour the woodlands for berries and other goodies. In the meantime, she can hope that one of her classmates will slip her a sandwich. But in economically depressed Zalyshany, such largesse is fitful. The lunch cancellations did not affect kindergartens, such as the one that’s in the same building as the local school. The kindergarten’s cook, Lyubov Shevchuk, sometimes slips the older children a little something. “Children faint and fall. I try to at least give them some hot tea, or take from one child to give to another,” she said. With no government agency taking responsibility for feeding the schoolchildren, it’s left to warmhearted efforts like Shevchuk’s or to charities. An Italian group, Mondo in Cammino, took notice of the Zone 4 lunch cancellations and raised money to supply the 130 pupils in one village, Radynka, with a year’s lunches at a cost of 15,000 euros ($17,000). “We know that Ukraine is near default. They decided that these families were no longer children of Chernobyl,” said the organization’s director, Massimo Bonfatti. The overall effects of radioactive fallout remain intensely debated. A United Nations report concluded that the additional radioactivity over a 20-year period was approximately equivalent to that of a CAT scan, because of higher levels of the long-lived cesium-137. Ausrele Kesminiene, a doctor with the World Health Organization, said there is little evidence associating radioactivity-contaminated food with cancers other than in the thyroid. But a review compiled by the Greenpeace environmentalist group and published in March found scientific studies indicating children in areas contaminated like Zalyshany show much-reduced respiratory capacity. A European Union-funded study tracking 4,000 children for three years in contaminated areas also found cardiovascular insufficiencies in 81 percent of the children. Yuri Bandazhevsky, a pediatrician who has studied the effect of small doses of radiation on the human body, said there are “very serious pathological processes” which can lead to defects of the cardiovascular system and cancer. Bandazhevsky, whose work is widely cited abroad, was imprisoned in his native Belarus for four years. Supporters allege it was due to his work on studying Chernobyl’s consequences; he now works in Ukraine. “With regret I have to state that nobody cares about this, and those hungry children are another proof of how authorities treat a population which suffers on these territories,” he said. Nadezhda Ivanchenko, whose grandson was monitored in the European Union study, agreed that the government seems callous. She brought the 10-year-old boy for examination at the hospital in the district center of Ivankiv. He shows advanced sinus arrhythmia of the heart. “People get sick a lot, but neither children nor anyone here are needed. We were thrown away and forgotten,” she said. Olesya, the 9-year-old who now often has to go without lunch, wants to eventually become a doctor, so she can “treat everybody for radiation.” But for right now, her desire is to fill her stomach with treats foraged from the woods. “In the forest, you don’t need money,” she said. “There’s all kinds of food that can feed everyone.” Associated Press writers Jim Heintz in Moscow and Colleen Barry in Milan, Italy, contributed to this story.

West Virginia gets OK for summer food benefits for students,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia families with eligible school-age children will receive funding from the federal government for groceries this summer. One-time benefits of $375 are expected to be issued for each eligible child by mid-July, the state Department of Education said in a news release. The benefits will be loaded onto existing pandemic electronic benefits transfer cards that were issued during the 2020-21 school year. School-age children are eligible if they were enrolled in a school that participates in the National School Lunch Program and qualified for free or reduced-price school meals. Children under age 6 are eligible if they live in a household that receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. The state expects to issue $83.4 million to more than 222,000 schoolchildren and $13.3 million to 35,000 kids enrolled in SNAP this summer. The funding comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) — As the school bell rings, dozens of children begin filing into the canteen at Hillstone Primary School. The day’s offering, a roast dinner, is a popular one, and many are eager to tuck into their plates of turkey slices, roasted potatoes, broccoli and gravy. For some children in this area of suburban Birmingham, central England, where many families are low income, it may be the only nutritious hot meal in a day. Some students eating sandwiches from their lunchboxes instead say they get one hot lunch a week, but they would like more. “My mum says it costs a bit more,” one girl said last week. Free school lunches are provided for all 4- to 7-year-olds in England, but most parents of older children have to pay about 2.20 pounds ($2.70) a day for their child to have a cooked meal. That may sound like a small amount, but charities and teachers say it’s becoming increasingly unaffordable for hundreds of thousands of families struggling to cope with the United Kingdom’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Whether Britain’s government should spend to feed more schoolchildren is a hot-button issue as more families fall into poverty and cannot afford basics after paying their skyrocketing energy and food bills. The government said it will keep reviewing meal eligibility and pointed to other relief given to needy families. Inflation in the U.K. has hit a 41-year high of 11.1%, driven in large part by gas and electricity costs, which have almost doubled from last winter amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. Prices for staples like milk, butter and pasta also have shot up by some 30%.  To qualify for free school lunches, England’s households have to receive government benefits and earn less than 7,400 pounds ($9,021) a year. That’s below the threshold in parts of the U.S., Europe and even elsewhere in the U.K. The Food Foundation, a charity leading a campaign to extend the free school lunch program, argues the income level is too low. It estimates that 800,000 children in England are living in poverty but not eligible for free meals. “It’s those children who we are really worried right now during the cost-of-living crisis, because those families are having to make really tough choices about where to spend their money,” said Anna Taylor, the charity’s executive director. To save cash, many parents don’t pay for a school meal and pack their kids a lunch, which often isn’t as nutritious, Taylor said. “We’ve been hearing from teachers that children are going to school with empty lunchboxes or with stuff that they’re very ashamed to show to their friends,” she added. During the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Food Foundation and soccer star Marcus Rashford persuaded Britain’s government to provide free meals to children in poverty over the school holidays. Rashford, who spoke of his mother struggling to put food on the table, helped sway the government to change its policies that allowed 1.3 million children to claim free meals. Taylor said many Britons are now even worse off because some never recovered from pandemic job losses before being hit with massively higher bills. Monthly surveys conducted by her charity suggested that the number of families saying they have had to skip or have smaller meals because they couldn’t afford food has doubled over the course of January to October. “It’s unprecedented levels of food insecurity right now,” she said. The Department of Education said the government understands the “pressures” many households face and that it is already giving cost-of-living subsidies to millions of the poorest families, supporting “more children and young people than ever before.” It added that officials will “keep all free school meal eligibility under review.” At Hillstone Primary, 51% of children qualify for free lunches, and headteacher Jason King says many of the others also need financial help. Some parents even approached the school for food. “When I started here 27 years ago, there were no food banks in the area. It wasn’t heard of,” King said. The school recently put together food parcels for a parent who said he had no money left for food. “They’ve got no food at home. They come to us — we’re not going to turn them away.” Louise Glew, a parent who volunteers at the school, said she was getting by but knew plenty of others struggling. She said she didn’t understand why the government couldn’t find the money to extend free school meals to all elementary students. “Parents are prideful, they don’t want to go, ‘I need help.’ But if the dinner was free for all (schoolchildren) they wouldn’t need to,” Glew said. “They would get a warm meal every day, and the parent wouldn’t have to panic, thinking, ‘Oh, have they had something warm? Have they eaten enough?’” The government said over one-third of students in England receive free school meals, including all 4- to 7-year-olds and about 1.9 million older children who qualify based on family income. England lags other parts of the U.K. The Welsh government, for example, says it will provide free school lunches for all elementary school students by 2024. Some European countries, like Sweden and Finland, provide free lunches almost entirely through school life. Others, like France and Germany, have varied policies including subsidies that depend on parents’ income. In the U.S., the states decide. A federal law made meals free for all schoolchildren during the pandemic, but those benefits expired before this school year. The experience has sparked local efforts to make universal free school lunch permanent, with California and Maine passing bills last year. In the U.K., Taylor acknowledged that the government has little spare cash for public spending but argued that the cost — an estimated 477 million pounds a year — is a long-term investment needed now more than ever. “This is not a sort of a ‘nice to have,’” she said. “Children will wear the effects of these decisions in their bodies and in their achievements in life.” AP reporter Ashraf Khalil contributed from Washington.

Others, like France and Germany, have varied policies including subsidies that depend on parents’ income. In the U.S., the states decide. A federal law made meals free for all schoolchildren during the pandemic, but those benefits expired before this school year. The experience has sparked local efforts to make universal free school lunch permanent, with California and Maine passing bills last year. In the U.K., Taylor acknowledged that the government has little spare cash for public spending but argued that the cost — an estimated 477 million pounds a year — is a long-term investment needed now more than ever. “This is not a sort of a ‘nice to have,’” she said. “Children will wear the effects of these decisions in their bodies and in their achievements in life.” AP reporter Ashraf Khalil contributed from Washington.

Study: Most urban Wisconsin schools were virtual in December,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Almost all urban Wisconsin schools taught their students virtually in December compared with only a fraction or rural schools, according to a study released Monday. The Wisconsin Policy Forum released findings based on a state survey of Wisconsin schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program. About four of every five public and private schools responded to the survey. It found that 80% to 90% of urban schools had all or mostly virtual instruction in December depending on the grade. That compares with 40% to 50% of suburban schools and 14% to 18% of rural schools. The Wisconsin Policy Forum noted that the data is ambiguous in some cases. For example, if a grade is marked as 40% virtual, that could mean either all students are virtual two days a week or most students are attending class in-person five days a week but 40% chose an all-virtual option. Data for the early months of 2021 isn’t available yet. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(New York City Department of Education via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Forget mystery meat or cheese pizza. Instead, chickpea wraps and veggie tacos will be on the menu for New York City public school students as the nation’s largest school district shifts to “Vegan Fridays” in school cafeterias. The move was pushed by the city’s new Mayor Eric Adams, who follows and promotes a plant-based diet that he credits for improving his health. “I can’t tell people what to put on their grills on the weekend. But darn it, we should not be feeding the health care crisis in our prisons, our hospitals, and most importantly, in our schools, so we want to go in a more healthy direction,” Adams said in an interview on WNBC-TV on Friday. Vegan options are already available in all of the city’s public schools every day, but starting Friday and continuing weekly, the lunch offering will be vegan. Students can still request a non-vegan option, according to the city’s Department of Education, and milk, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, hummus and pretzels will always be available to students. New York City public schools, which have about 938,000 students, have been offering Meatless Mondays since 2019 and Meatless Fridays since April. Around the country, 14% of school districts offered vegan meals and 56% offered vegetarian meals in at least one of their schools, according to a 2018 survey from the School Nutrition Association, a trade group representing school nutrition programs and workers. It’s unclear whether any other districts around the country plan to go vegan one day a week like New York City schools.  New York City schools says its vegan meals have been tested and approved by small groups of students. Friday’s menu included “vegan veggie tacos,” with a tortilla and salsa, with broccoli, and a carrot and lemon salad on the side. Other planned offerings this month include a Mediterranean chickpea dish with rice or pasta, and a black bean and plantain rice bowl. Adams, a former New York City police captain, has said he traded in a lifestyle with junk food for a plant-based diet that helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a book about his diet, “Healthy at Last.” Nearly 40% of New York City public school children in grades K-8 were overweight or obese, according to data cited by the city in 2019. Angela Odoms-Young, an associate professor in the nutritional sciences division at Cornell University who helped develop the nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program, said the shift in New York City schools is “innovative and exciting.” Odoms-Young said adding in plant-based meals can help ensure students are getting the recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables a day, expose them to foods they might not normally consume and reinforce lifelong healthy habits. She also said it could dispel the notion of children being resistant to eating vegetables. “It doesn’t just have to be broccoli,” Odoms-Young said. “It can just be a whole host of things that maybe kids would eat — particularly if it’s prepared in different ways.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Idaho kills bill allowing public money for private education,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A House panel on Tuesday rejected legislation that opponents said would have harmed education by transferring more than $1 billion dollars of public money to private and religious schools. Backers had said the measure would have improved Idaho education through competition. But it was too much of a change for a majority of members of the House Education Committee, who voted 8-7 to kill the measure that would have allowed qualifying families to get $6,000 per student from the state private school tuition or private tutoring. Backers had framed the measure as a parental-choice bill to give parents the option to to send kids to private school using money from what the bill dubbed the “Hope and Opportunity Scholarship Program.” Supporters said parents paid taxes into the system and therefore should be able to participate in a program to get money from the state to send their kids to a private school. “This is taxpayer funded,” said Republican Rep. Dorothy Moon, one of the bill’s sponsors. “This is their money. Everybody keeps saying the school district’s money. No, it’s our money.” But opponents said the measure would have degraded public education and violated the Idaho Constitution, which requires a uniform system of public free public education. “What we would be doing here would be unconstitutional,” said Republican Rep. Gary Marshall, a retired teacher. “We’re clearly crossing that line.”  Some bill backers agreed with that assessment, but also said they disagreed with the Idaho Constitution and supported the measure anyway. “This is an amendment that we should remove from our constitution,” said Republican Rep. Judy Boyle. “It is a terrible thing, I think. It’s biased. It’s unfair, and we never should have had to put it in in the beginning.” Republican Rep. Julie Yamamoto, a retired teacher who voted to kill the bill, said that the way to change the Idaho Constitution isn’t by passing an unconstitutional bill, but by passing a measure with two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate and then getting a simple majority of Idaho voters in a general election. “I told people in my community that I would be a principle-centered representative, and my principles say I don’t go against the state constitution,” she said. Besides arguing over the bill’s constitutionality, lawmakers also took issue with the proposed cost. Moon and Republican Rep. Gayann DeMordaunt, another of the bill’s sponsors, said in the bill’s fiscal note that in the first year it would have cost about $13 million. But Democratic Rep. Steve Berch said that was a low-ball number and that under the bill’s guidelines, more than 200,000 Idaho students would qualify at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion. “This is not a school-choice bill. This is a who-pays-for-someone-else’s-school-choice bill,” Berch said. “This (bill) becomes the gateway for those who hope to create the opportunity of privatizing education.” Backers referenced a similar program in Arizona for comparison. But that program has a much more restrictive policy on who qualifies. The proposed bill in Idaho was based on national criteria for a school lunch program, which Berch said made 68% of Idaho students eligible to get money to attend a private or religious school. Some lawmakers representing rural areas opposed the plan because they said it shortchanged rural areas with no private schools. Most of Idaho’s 121 private schools are in more urban areas. Republican Rep. Ryan Kerby said he couldn’t support the bill because it included religious private schools. He said his primary concern was that such schools would be pressured to water down their curriculum on such things as gender issues and marriage beliefs if they wanted to take part in the program and get taxpayer money that had been provided to parents for tuition payments. “There’s going to be pressure on the schools to change,” he said, noting he started working in education in the 1970s at a private Christian school. “I think we’re going to lose, potentially, the purity of doctrine in our Catholic and our Christian schools.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Wisconsin school board reverses on opting out of free meals,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin school district has reversed a decision to leave a federal free meals program following widespread criticism and loud protests from parents and others. Waukesha school board members said they received threats in the wake of national attention after voting to opt out of the program that was providing free breakfast and lunch to all students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The board voted 5-4 on Monday to reverse course while parents and others packed the meeting room and two overflow rooms. Board member Karin Rajnicek said after the board’s previous vote to end the free program that it made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Even without the program, Waukesha students from low-income families still would have been able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more COVID-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside. The decision also allowed students to be fed regardless of their ability to pay, qualify, persuade their parents to fill out forms or withstand possible stigma associated with qualifying.  Of the 97% of Wisconsin school districts that were eligible, Waukesha was the only one to opt out of the extension this school year, according to the state Department of Public Instruction. Some board members said if they voted to reverse course, it would be giving in to a “hateful mob” and giving over power to the federal government, the  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. “It’s time for parents and community members to start paying attention to the forces at work here,” board member Kelly Piacsek said. “When the federal government is responsible for feeding all students at all times regardless of need, they have ultimate authority and we don’t need local school boards anymore.” Piacsek, who was interrupted by applause as she spoke, said it wasn’t “about food anymore,” but about national influences on local school boards. Board member Anthony Zenobia accused administrators of asking for the change of course “because of intimidation and threats.” Like Piacsek, he opposed using more federal funds for meals. “If it’s food and free lunch today, it will be forced masking, forced whatever-we-want-to-do in schools because the mob will have the power to tell us what to do,” Zenobia said.

"Auto shop pays $2,033 to clear unpaid school lunch debts","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SUTTONS BAY, Mich. (AP) — An auto repair shop has tuned up the lunch accounts at a northern Michigan school district. To celebrate five years in business, the owners of Mr. Hoxie’s Garage wrote a check for $2,033.99 to cover unpaid student lunch debts in Suttons Bay, near Traverse City, the Record-Eagle reported. “We know what a trying year this has been for so many, especially for the kids, so we wanted to find a way to help relieve some of the stress that comes with attending school on a daily basis,” Grant Hoxie said. Kris Hoxie said the couple usually supports school arts and sports, but COVID-19 disrupted those programs. “We all need a break right now, and this generous gesture will certainly help us to spread some joy to Suttons Bay families this year,” Superintendent Casey Petz said. Kris Hoxie said she has talked to other business owners in the Leelanau County community about making a five-year pledge to the school lunch program. “This would take a basic need expense away” from families, especially large ones, she said.

Toxic ‘forever chemicals’ found in Michigan farm’s beef,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Beef produced at a small Michigan farm was found to contain toxic “forever chemicals” after the cattle were fed crops grown with fertilizer made from contaminated wastewater biosolids, state officials said Friday. A consumption advisory issued by state agencies stopped short of a recall, noting there are no government standards for the substances in beef. But it said buyers should know that meat from Grostic Cattle Co. in Livingston County may contain one of the chemicals known collectively as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The particular compound in the beef is known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services “determined that prolonged consumption of the beef from this farm could increase PFOS levels in the human body,” a news release said. High levels of water- and grease-resistant PFAS chemicals, which are used in a host of industrial and consumer products, have been linked to numerous health problems, from liver and thyroid damage to high cholesterol and compromised immune systems. They are known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in the environment or the human body. Studies have shown that crops treated with PFAS-laced biosolids can absorb the chemicals, so it’s reasonable that cattle given those foods would have detectable levels in their bodies, said Jamie DeWitt, an East Carolina University toxicologist. PFAS has also turned up in milk at some dairy farms. Grostic Cattle Co. has cooperated with the state’s investigation, according to the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team. The company is notifying customers and removing its beef and affected cattle from the market. The state is providing financial help to reimburse buyers.  “Needless to say, I and my family are surprised to find ourselves and our beloved farm in the middle of a PFAS contamination issue,” owner Jason Grostic said in an email. “Our family farm has been serving the state of Michigan for 100 years. It is because of that commitment that we intend to cooperate with all city, state, county and federal agencies to determine who is responsible for this unfortunate situation.” The 300-acre operation, which has about 120 cows, sells primarily to individual customers at farm markets and elsewhere, said Scott Dean, spokesman for the state Department of the Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. The Livingston Educational Service Agency said it bought about 30 pounds of the farm’s beef for school lunch programs last fall and had used it in chili served one day per month. “We will be disposing of all remaining beef that we have in inventory and using a different provider in the future,” the agency said. Grostic Cattle Co. came under scrutiny during a four-year state investigation of sites where municipal wastewater biosolids tainted with PFAS have been spread as cropland fertilizers. Michigan last year banned land applications of industrial biosolids containing more than 150 parts per billion of PFOS and requires testing of biosolids before they are placed on land. In 2018, high levels of PFOS were detected in wastewater from the city of Wixom’s treatment plant. Biosolid material generated there contained 2,150 ppb. The chemicals originated from a chrome plating facility that discharged wastewater to the plant. The Michigan PFAS Action Response Team focused on the Wixom plant and several others for a study of how the agricultural use of biosolids containing the chemicals can affect the environment. Investigators tested soil and water at farm fields that had used Wixom biosolids. Data from a shallow groundwater monitoring well revealed the presence of a PFAS compound at Grostic Cattle Co. Further testing found PFAS in cattle feed crops grown there, as well as in manure and soil. The farm provided frozen beef cuts for analysis this month at a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab, which measured an average PFOS level of 1.9 ppb. “These results were lower than USDA’s current health screening value and lower than beef samples previously tested in other states,” the state PFAS team said, adding that it decided to notify the public out of caution. Abigail Hendershott, executive director of the PFAS team, described the Grostic farm beef contamination as “a rare occurrence” that probably wouldn’t happen again because of the state’s crackdown on discharges of the chemicals to wastewater plants and their presence in biosolids. The Grostic farm received “the largest and most frequent applications of the Wixom treatment plants biosolids,” she said. But activist groups said the discovery was alarming. Biosolids are believed to be responsible for the contamination of wells in several counties, the Michigan League of Conservation Voters said. “We know there is a PFAS contamination crisis in our state, and it is unfortunately no surprise that food and crops can be impacted, ” said Tony Spaniola, co-chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network.

(AP Photo/LM Otero, File) Americans can begin applying for $50 off their monthly internet bill on Wednesday as part of an emergency government program to keep people connected during the pandemic. The $3.2 billion program is part of the  $900 billion December pandemic-relief package.  The government is increasing spending on broadband as the  pandemic made stark that millions of Americans did not have access to, and could not afford, broadband at a time when jobs, school and health care was moving online. It’s unclear how long the money will last but it’s expected to be several months. Tens of millions of people are eligible, although the Federal Communications Commission, which is administering the program, did not specify a number. For example, your household is eligible if you receive food stamps, have a child in the free or reduced-price school lunch program, use Medicaid, or lost income during the pandemic and made $99,000 for single filers, or $198,000 for joint filers, or less. There are other eligibility requirements, too — see https://getemergencybroadband.org to find out if you qualify. The website, where people submit applications for the benefit, on Wednesday afternoon said the program was having “connectivity issues” due to “high demand.” Submitting an application resulted in an error message. A phone number for the program played a message saying there was a “high volume of calls” and to try back later. The FCC said it is working to resolve issues and increasing resources to meet demand for the program. The agency did not say how long the fix will take.  You can get the discount even if you owe your phone or cable company money. That’s important because some people have been barred from low-cost plans offered by internet service providers when they owed their service provider money. More than 800 cellphone and home-internet companies are participating, including AT&T, Charter, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon. People in tribal areas are eligible for up to $75 off their bill. There is also a $100 reimbursement for desktop computers, laptops or tablets — in that case, you must pay between $10 and $50 of the cost of the device yourself and buy it through your broadband provider. The discount could apply to a household’s whole bill, or you can use it to trade up to a more expensive offering and your bill is partly covered. The Emergency Broadband Benefit is a more robust, although temporary, program to help people afford internet than Lifeline, the FCC’s other affordability program, which subtracts only $9.25 a month from phone or internet bills. A household can use both the Lifeline and EBB programs. The Biden administration  has proposed $100 billion to get Americans connected, and even before that, billions of dollars are going to improve internet access. The FCC on Tuesday approved a $7.2 billion program for schools and libraries  to connect students in their homes. The Treasury Department is also setting up a $10 billion fund for improving internet connectivity. The money for both came from the $1.9 trillion March pandemic relief package. There has also been hundreds of billions more in general funds sent to states that could be spent on broadband access. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Lawmakers advance bill to prevent ‘lunch shaming’ students,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Schools would be banned from “lunch shaming” students unable to afford school meals, under a bill that was narrowly advanced by a Tennessee House panel on Wednesday. The proposal, sponsored by Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons, would ban schools from requiring students with lunch debt to do chores, miss school activities, graduations or other activities that would publicly identify the student as being unable to pay for a meal. Schools would also have to assist parents and guardians obtain free or reduced-price meals for their students and offer to find any other available assistance. The measure passed the House Education Committee, 13-10. It must still pass the fully House and Senate. Advocates across the country are trying to stop lunchroom practices that can humiliate children. Embarrassing tactics have included serving cheap sandwiches in place of hot meals or sending students home with conspicuous debt reminders, such as hand stamps. New Mexico passed a law against lunch shaming in 2017, and several other states including California, Iowa and Oregon have followed suit. In Tennessee, the bill has faced resistance from the GOP-dominated Statehouse as some members cast doubt on the scope of the problem throughout the state. Before the bill advanced on Wednesday, Republican Rep. John Ragan attempted to dramatically rewrite the proposal with an amendment.  The Oak Ridge lawmaker’s amendment would require the state to provide “lunch at no cost to the student or the student’s parent.” However, the amendment carried a $341 million price tag —- which other lawmakers pointed out would effectively torpedo the legislation because it’s not currently budgeted in the governor’s spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year. “I am more than happy to sponsor that legislation as a separate matter ... but this amendment would kill this legislation,” Clemmons said. Ragan unsuccessfully attempted to block lawmakers from individually voicing their support or opposition — seeking instead a voice vote where no roll is taken — but was overruled by fellow committee members who went on to spike the amendment. Free and reduced-price meals funded by the Agriculture Department’s National School Lunch Program shield the nation’s poorest children from so-called lunch shaming. Kids can eat for free if a family of four earns less than about $32,000 a year or at a discount if earnings are under $45,000. The national school lunch program serves around 30 million children. Roughly 20 million of those students qualify for free lunches, and 2 million qualify for a reduced price lunch of 40 cents. That means approximately 8 million pay the regular price determined by local districts — leaving students with unpaid meal debt open to possible lunch shaming. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Among those teaming up for the launch are philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, Apple and the Ford Foundation. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) LOS ANGELES (AP) — Leonardo DiCaprio will help launch America’s Food Fund, which has already raised $12 million to help communities impacted by the coronavirus. The organization said Thursday that the funds will be aimed to help low-income families, the elderly, individuals facing job disruptions and children who rely on school lunch programs. The food fund will work with hunger relief organizations World Central Kitchen and Feeding America. DiCaprio serves as a co-founder of America’s Food Fund with philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs. Apple and the Ford Foundation are also providing money to help launch the new initiative. “In the face of this crisis, organizations like World Central Kitchen and Feeding America have inspired us all with their unwavering commitment to feed the most vulnerable people in need,” DiCaprio said in a statement. “I thank them for their tireless work on the frontlines, they deserve all of our support.” On Thursday, Oprah Winfrey announced a $1 million donation to the fund and $10 million in total to feed the hungry during the crisis. The new coronavirus has caused a global pandemic that has sickened hundreds of thousands of people and killed more than 47,000 worldwide, crippled economies and forced restrictions on the movement of millions of people in an effort to stop the virus from spreading further and overwhelming health care systems. “In times of need, a plate of food is both vital nourishment and a message of hope from the community, that we care and we’re here to make sure that tomorrow, things will be better,” said José Andrés, founder of World Central Kitchen.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Organizers say donations to America’s Food Fund are being accepted  and will be used on efforts to get meals to those who need them. “With millions losing their jobs and programs like school lunches in jeopardy, making sure people aren’t going hungry is of the utmost urgency,” said Powell Jobs.

Here’s a test with just one question: If a hungry child can’t afford to eat, should the adults in her school punish and humiliate her for not having lunch money? As disgraceful as this question is, adults in schools across the country fail this test every single day. New Mexico has just become the first state in the nation to ban “lunch shaming” — policies that penalize children who don’t have enough money to buy a hot lunch in the cafeteria. New Mexico’s new law, the “Hunger-Free Students’ Bill of Rights,” is a welcome move that has helped put a spotlight on a common form of cruel and unusual punishment against poor children. State Sen. Michael Padilla, the lawmaker who introduced it, understands what it’s like to be hungry at school. As a child growing up in the foster care system, he often couldn’t afford lunch either. He said in the New York Times: “I made Mrs. Ortiz and Mrs. Jackson, our school lunch ladies, my best friends. Thank goodness they took care of me, but I had to do other things like mop the floor in the cafeteria. It was really noticeable that I was one of the poor kids in the school.” In another interview he remembered that in addition to having to clean tables or help in the kitchen, sometimes his school lunch would be taken away or replaced with a slice of bread and cheese. “I’m 44 now, and I was shocked to find out that this was still happening. This is still a very real issue here in the United States,” Padilla said.  Requiring chores in exchange for food or replacing hot nutritious lunches with cold cheese and bread are common occurrences in many communities. In 2016, Pennsylvania elementary school lunch worker Stacy Koltiska made headlines when she said she quit her job over her district’s policy of denying hot lunches to students with debt and replacing them with cold cheese sandwiches after seeing tears in a child’s eyes. She said, “As a Christian, I have an issue with this. It’s sinful and shameful is what it is . . . God is love, and we should love one another and be kind. There’s enough wealth in this world that no child should go hungry, especially in school. To me this is just wrong.” This wrong is compounded in other school districts which use physical marks on the children to “remind” parents that they haven’t paid, as Arizona parent Tara Chavez learned when her son came home from his elementary school earlier this month with the words “LUNCH MONEY” stamped in block letters on his arm. She later learned her son’s school lunch account had money in it but was low. “I asked if he was given a choice by the lunch lady and he said, ‘No, she just grabbed my wrist and put the stamp on’ . . . I think there’s a better way to communicate the message than stamping a child with the word ‘Lunch Money.’ There’s a billion other ways you could do it that would be better than that.” Still other schools do not feed children at all. The New York Times shared the story of an Omaha school cafeteria cashier who asked to resign her position at a school with a “no money, no meal” policy: “She had been secretly paying for students’ meals,” a coworker remembered, “and couldn’t afford to keep it up.” School districts argue that “lunch shaming” tactics are necessary to weed out children whose families can afford to pay for meals but forget or choose not to, adding to the debt the schools are forced to absorb. Unpaid meals can add up: one study notes the School Nutrition Association found about 75 percent of districts had some unpaid student meal debt at the end of the last school year. But the same article notes many students who cannot pay for their meals actually qualify for free or reduced priced meals through the federal school lunch program but aren’t signed up. During the 2015-2016 school year 21.6 million children received free or reduced price lunches through the National School Lunch Program. The federal program also includes a community eligibility provision which allows school districts, individual schools, or groups of schools to offer two nutritious meals daily to all students at no charge if more than 40 percent of their students meet certain eligibility standards that should help address the unpaid meal fees problem. Last school year more than 18,000 high poverty schools in nearly 3,000 school districts across the country — serving more than 8.5 million children — participated in this program, giving them the chance to serve all of their students without the administrative burdens of taking applications and collecting meal fees and without being forced to turn children away. But many other eligible schools haven’t yet implemented this program. The right answer should not depend on the kindness of lunch ladies or cruel school district policies that shame children and leave them hungry for more than food. The federal Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 required the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to examine the challenges of unpaid school meal fees. USDA sent a Report to Congress, Review of Local Policies on Meal Charges and Provision of Alternate Meals, in June 2016 and issued guidance requiring school districts participating in the National School Lunch or School Breakfast program, beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, to establish policies and procedures to address the challenge of unpaid school meal fees, although significant local discretion is allowed on the content of the policy. States also may develop policies or guidelines for all school districts to follow. The USDA’s website includes resources to help states and school districts develop, disseminate and implement effective policies for children and families. If we love our children the only moral choice in this rich country should be making sure children have access to the food they need. Schools are on the front line with hungry children entering classrooms every day and have a special obligation to ensure those children have the healthy food they need to concentrate and thrive. As the new law in New Mexico now requires, schools should be offering to help eligible poor children sign up for the federal free or reduced price lunch program, rather than shaming them and denying them food for the “sins of their parents.” Jennifer Ramo, the executive director of the anti-poverty and anti-hunger group New Mexico Appleseed who helped draft the law said, “People on both sides of the aisle were genuinely horrified that schools were allowed to throw out children’s food or make them work to pay off debt. It sounds like some scene from ‘Little Orphan Annie,’ but it happens every day . . . We have to separate the child from a debt they have no power to pay.” She added in another interview: “We’re saying feed these children first, and let the grownups sort out the finances.” Other states, including Texas and California, are already working on similar anti-shaming legislation of their own. Every state should follow New Mexico’s example and ban this heartless and stupid practice. No child in rich America, the world’s largest exporter of food, should go hungry. Adults in schools who set this policy or carry out the cruel and unusual punishments are the ones who should be ashamed. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump food stamp change could affect 200K Florida students,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida education officials and advocates say about 200,000 students could become ineligible for automatic free school lunches under a Trump administration proposal expected to reduce the number of food stamps enrollees. News outlets reported the figures this week and say a finalized rule could come as soon as the end of the month. Children automatically qualify for free lunches if their families receive food stamps, but in July the Trump administration proposed tightening eligibility for what was formerly called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The U.S. Agriculture Department released an analysis in October showing nearly 1 million students nationwide could be affected. News outlets say impacted Florida households would still be eligible for free- and reduced-price meals if they individually file an application for the National School Lunch Program.

Insider Q&A: T-Mobile pushes internet for virtual school,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. These undated photos provided by T-Mobile shows, from left, T-Mobile executives Matt Staneff and Mike Katz. T-Mobile is pushing to offer internet service to schools that are doing online learning with a program aimed at low-income students who don’t have access. (T-Mobile via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — T-Mobile is pushing to offer internet service to schools that are doing online learning with a program aimed at low-income students who don’t have access. In the U.S., millions of students don’t have high-speed internet or computers at home — a difficult enough situation when it was just about trying to get homework done, but a much bigger problem when many school districts have moved part or all of the school day online during the coronavirus pandemic. School districts are spending big to address the crisis. The L.A. Unified School District is investing $100 million in online learning, including computers and internet service for kids who don’t have them. T-Mobile wants to expand its business that serves large organizations like big companies and schools. It had already planned to give districts 100 gigabytes of free wireless data per year per student, a commitment the company made while pursuing its acquisition of Sprint. But since that allotment wouldn’t last more than a few months if kids streamed school all day, T-Mobile is adding two paid plans as well: $12 a month per household for 100GB, or $15 a month for unlimited data. The carrier says those prices are discounted to reflect the free-data offer. Matt Staneff, T-Mobile’s chief marketing officer, and Mike Katz, an executive who leads the T-Mobile division that caters to large organizations like schools and big companies, spoke with The Associated Press about the company’s new effort to serve schools. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Q: Is providing connectivity to schools something that you see as a big business opportunity?  Staneff: Sure, there’s business opportunities there. But the motivation of doing this is that we recognize there’s a problem in society of kids not being connected. We want to do more than just try to win customers. This is a huge problem. Q: And you think 10 million kids have connection issues that stops them from being able to do online school? Estimates vary, but I’ve seen higher numbers. (A new study says between 15 million and 16 million public-school students  don’t have adequate internet connections or devices for online school.) Staneff: There’s another data point that says 56% of school-age kids have had trouble completing their homework. And that’s a little bit broader because it’s not just the internet. A lot of them do it on a phone. They have internet access. It could be that they need a bigger screen, which is why we’re also offering at-cost, larger-screen devices. We’ve looked at the enrollments in the school lunch program, we’ve looked at all the Census data. That’s what this number is. Q: What have you been charging schools for getting internet to students who don’t have it? Katz: It ranges greatly. I can tell you this program is now going to be our main education program. The district, they can get unlimited starting at $15. That’s value that’s not available anywhere else in the market, and it enables schools to then pass through service at no cost to the students. Q: So does the new program offer better pricing for schools than what’s available to them from T-Mobile now? Katz: It’s netting so prices are lower than what we’ve done at any time. Q: How long will this be available? Staneff: Once you sign up, you’re good for five years. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Des Moines Public Schools official revamps lunch program,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — On the last day before winter break, students at two Des Moines elementary schools were eagerly awaiting their special hot lunches of pizza and macaroni and cheese. The truck that normally delivers their meals was preparing to unload at about 11 a.m. when the liftgate broke, stranding the students’ lunches inside. As soon as Amanda Miller, head of Des Moines Public Schools’ Food and Nutrition Management, heard, she gathered her team and quickly came up with two options: — They could send pre-made sack lunches of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches immediately. They were frozen, but they’d thaw on the way — hopefully. — They could delay lunch by less than an hour and prepare hot meals of cheese pizza and mixed veggies. On a day where the temperature hadn’t hit 40 degrees, the school principals chose the second. A third option — letting kids wait until an afternoon snack or until they got home — was never on the table. Miller’s team, who churned out more than 800 hot meals in 45 minutes that day, exists to make sure kids get fed — broken liftgate or not. Miller’s life has been marked by a deep love for both food and education. As the newly minted director of Des Moines’ school lunch program, the 38-year-old’s two passions help her lead a team that is serving students better by offering healthy choices, catering to the changing tastes of Des Moines families and maintaining fiscal responsibility. For the district, food is as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Kids simply aren’t hungry to learn when they are physically hungry, Miller said.  Superintendent Tom Ahart agreed, adding that food insecurity and poverty “negatively impact the educational process in a variety of ways.” Simply feeding kids “doesn’t solve the problem, but it certainly lessens the impact,” he said. DMPS serves about 15,000 breakfasts, 22,000 lunches and 1,500 healthy snacks a day during the school year. Last summer, Miller’s team served about 90,000 lunches and 50,000 breakfasts. They are also in charge of school gardens; the food rescue program, which recycles uneaten shelf-stable items; and nutrition education courses, including the “pick a better snack” program, which features lessons on a food of the month. (This year’s selections have included sweet potatoes, pears and kiwi.) Miller’s team also partners with the Boys & Girls Club to serve about 200 suppers daily, meaning that for about 200 local kids, it’s likely the only meals they eat are supplied by their school. “Amanda never lets us say we can’t do that,” said Chad Taylor, head chef for DMPS. “Sometimes there is a tendency to say ‘we can’t, we can’t, we can’t,’ but Amanda says, ‘How can we think differently to say we can?’” In her first year on the job, Miller made instituting free classroom breakfasts in all elementary schools, as well as many of the middle and high schools, her marquee issue. The program went into effect in the fall and, so far, every school is reporting positive results, the Des Moines Register reported . “When everyone eats breakfast at school, we lift the stigma,” Miller said. “It’s not just the ‘poor kids’ or the ‘bus kids’ or whomever, everyone eats at school.” From a strong social media presence to innovative menu ideas, the Miller-era school lunch program is about much more than chicken nuggets. It’s focused on “creating a culture where we can support families and allow students to succeed and learn and grow,” she said. (Though don’t get her wrong, chicken nuggets are still very important.) Miller doesn’t get into the field as much as she wants to, but she makes a point to go to a school lunch at least once a week. There she hovers, watching what kids pick for lunch, how long it takes them to eat and what they throw away. “That’s a good-looking lunch,” she tells a second-grader who has selected both cherry tomatoes and green beans to go along with his chicken nuggets. Miller hasn’t been in the classroom for a few years — she worked at the state’s Department of Education before joining DMPS — but she still finds joy and purpose in being around kids. After getting hot food, each student passes through a fresh fruits and veggies bar where, on this day, they can select from a berry mixture, pineapple slices, cherry tomatoes or a three-bean salad. Choice has become an important part of DMPS school lunch. Servers communicate with students about what they want to eat before plating, she said. “We want to make sure they feel like they have control over what they eat,” she said, “and we think that will help them make healthier choices in the future, too.” The Trump administration recently relaxed regulations surrounding school lunch, but Miller and her team are sticking with the Obama-era guidelines, which call for more whole grains and less sodium. “I don’t see any reason to change at this point,” she said. When Miller was a child, she’d host her very own cooking show — “Cooking with Mandy” — to an assemblage of teddy bears. Her younger brother pretended to be the camera operator and sometimes her parents, Bob and Victorica, would be drafted into the audience. “I’d measure all my ingredients out and tell the ‘audience’ what we were making,” Miller remembered. “It was kind of silly, but so fun and, looking back, I think it really helped to develop my love for cooking and for food.” Miller’s childhood was marked by activities, her parents said. From speech to volleyball to student council, Miller was always doing something with someone. After graduating from Forest City High School, she went to Waldorf Community College before getting a bachelor’s in food science from Iowa State University. Her first job was at Wolf Appliances, where she’d researched oven cycles by making yellow cakes and roasting chickens. She didn’t dislike the job, but she spent most days in a test kitchen all alone. “She gets so much energy and strength from interacting with people, it was clear to us that she needed to be back around people to be truly happy,” said her father, a retired superintendent. She got another bachelor’s degree and eventually became a family and consumer science teacher at West Des Moines Valley High School. There, she mixed her fondness for food with her newly discovered love of educating, throwing in a dash of creativity. At Valley, Miller had a class late in the day with mostly older kids, fellow teacher Carmen Clark remembered. It was a sort of disengaged group, and Miller had to come up with new ways to keep them hooked, Clark said. “One day I saw her walking the hallways with this class and she was teaching them as they were walking. She knew those five or six kids needed to be moving to pay attention,” Clark said. “She made up songs and chants. I mean, she was just willing to do whatever it took to help kids learn.” While the DMPS lunch crew is always looking for new ways to lower sugar, lower sodium and cut calories in the right spots, chef Taylor is also actively trying to add more ethnic flavors to their menu. As a majority-minority school district, principals constantly seek ways to make their students feel more comfortable at school, Taylor said. Food is an easy way to make classrooms feel a little more like home. This year’s menu features food from all over the world, including a spicy curry bowl, a vegetarian sweet potato curry, fish tacos topped with coleslaw, and a Thai bowl with noodles, a peanut-like sauce and fish or chicken. “People are very judgmental of food, but we eliminate that prejudice when we add those flavors to the school menu,” Taylor said. “It goes from, ‘That’s weird,’ to, ‘Oh, yeah, we eat that at school.’” Taylor also seeks inspiration from the food he sees kids enjoying. His cheddar drop biscuits, for example, are a healthier version of Red Lobster’s. Miller’s team wants students to choose to eat with them. They are like a business in that way and as long as they can stay within the federal health guidelines, they are going to cater to the needs of their clients. “We are very aware that some of our students have other options,” Miller said. “All those kids could bring cold lunches from home, but they don’t and we know that by not bringing lunch, their parents are entrusting us with their child’s health. We don’t take that for granted.” About a decade ago, DMPS centralized their kitchen in the basement of the old Colonial Bread building. The move not only cut labor costs, but it also standardized the district’s food, much of which is still made from scratch. “The labor model is 20-30 people for the entire school system,” said Taylor. The nutrition program is in the black right now, Miller said, but her team keeps a close eye on how they are spending. In the district’s fiscal year 2018 budget, which runs from July 2017 to June 2018, Food and Nutrition Management is projected to bring in about $21 million in revenue and spend about $20 million, leaving about $900,000 excess to carry over. For the past three years, Miller’s department has been able to slowly add excess to their savings, which is projected to total about $3 million at the end of this school year, according to the budget posted to the district’s website. In Des Moines, about 75 percent of students qualify for free and reduced lunch, and 45 of the district’s 64 schools are part of the Community Eligibility Provision, meaning every student at those schools eats at no cost. While the most of the DMPS school lunch funding comes from the federal government’s meal reimbursement program, the district does receive some state money. In fiscal year 2018, the district is budgeted to receive about $19 million from the federal government and about $180,000 from the state. “We don’t have any other sources of revenue,” Miller said. “We can do caterings and that is some revenue, but reimbursement is how we make money and our budget is balanced to the penny.” In recent years, school lunch debt has been a recurring topic of conversation. Debt hasn’t been a large problem for Des Moines Public Schools because the nutrition department works closely with school administrations to get those that need financial help set up with applications for free and reduced lunches, Miller said. But when someone does slip into debt, she said the district will do whatever it can to help, including setting up payment plans. “There will always be debt in school meals,” Miller said. “That will never go away, but we are doing everything we can to figure out ways to get food to kids that need it.” Every time Miller is at a school watching lunch, she thinks of one particular student. He couldn’t have been older than a fourth-grader when he ran up to her a year ago to ask if he could have more of “those brown things covered in sauce.” Confused, Miller asked for clarification. Finally, she acquiesced and went to his plate to find baked beans. She showed him how to ask for more. “He was so hungry,” she said. “He ate his baked beans, oranges, corndogs and cherry tomatoes. He even stayed in from recess to continue eating. I don’t know what was happening in his life, whether he didn’t eat breakfast or was going through a growth spurt, but I was so proud we were able to give him what he needed in that moment.” As the director, Miller understands she ultimately is responsible for what happens with the DMPS lunch program, but she doesn’t do this alone, she stresses. There are more than 300 people that play a role in getting lunch to DMPS kids every day. “Amanda is inclusive of the whole team,” Taylor said. “She takes all of our ideas seriously and has never made me feel inferior in any way.” Even though Miller’s plate feels full a lot of days, she knows there are students’ plates that aren’t. She has a lot of ideas to expand the school lunch program, including snow-day and weekend meals and widening the supper program. There are some barriers to all that, she understands, but as long as everyone is guided by their mission to feed kids, there’s no question they’ll be able to do whatever they put their mind to. “If anyone is going to do it,” she said, “it’s going to be us.” Information from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"Virginia pastors give over $17,000 to pay student meal debts","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. STAFFORD, Va. (AP) — The holidays came early for some Virginia families struggling to pay school lunch debt. Three Virginia pastors used more than $17,000 from their church’s budget to pay off meal debt at two local school systems. “It seemed like a good idea, (but) we didn’t know if there was a need because no one ever seems to talk about this,” said the Rev. Jerry Williams, a pastor at Mount Ararat Baptist Church. “So we called the school systems. And gosh, wow, was there a need.” Williams, the Rev. Brian Bennett and the Rev. Andrew Segre gave $10,500 to Stafford County Public Schools and close to $7,000 to Spotsylvania County Public Schools, which wiped out balances across the district, news outlets reported. Keana Butler, principal of Park Ridge Elementary School in Stafford, said she was skeptical when the pastors emailed her about students’ meal debt. She said usually parent-teacher groups and members of her own staff pay out of pocket to help reduce the debt. “I was overwhelmed by the generosity,” Butler said. About 75% of schools districts nationally reported unpaid meal debt, with the median amount per school being about $2,500, according to The Washington Post, which cited the national School Nutrition Association. The median amount of unpaid debt increased 70% from the 2012-2013 school year. The Washington Post reported students across Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia owe nearly a $500,000 in meal debt. The Post also reported that although the National School Lunch Program allows some students to get free or reduced-price meals, many families who barely fail to qualify for federal aid still struggle to pay for school breakfast and lunch five days a week.  Williams said neither he nor the other pastors were aware of the meal debt statistics. They intend to pay off the debt again. He said he hopes their actions bring more awareness to the growing debt. “This is not a churchy thing,” Williams said. “This — helping children and families — this is a thing that anyone can do.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"School lunch rules OK refined grains, low-fat chocolate milk","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - In this Friday, May 19, 2017 file photo, students line up for lunch at a middle school in Sandy, Utah. On Thursday, Dec. 6, 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the scaling back contested school lunch standards implemented under the Obama administration, including one that required only whole grains be served. (Laura Seitz/The Deseret News via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. school lunch program is making room on menus again for noodles, biscuits, tortillas and other foods made mostly of refined grains. The Trump administration is scaling back contested school lunch standards implemented under the Obama administration including one that required only whole grains be served. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday only half the grains served will need to be whole grains, a change it said will do away with the current bureaucracy of requiring schools to obtain special waivers to serve select refined grains foods. Low-fat chocolate milk will also be allowed again. Previously, only fat-free milk could be flavored, although that rule had also been temporarily waived. A final goal for limiting sodium will be scrapped as well, but schools will still be required to meet reduced sodium targets. The School Nutrition Association, which represents local cafeteria operators and companies like Domino’s Pizza, Kellogg and PepsiCo, had called for relaxing the whole grain-only requirement, saying it was too difficult for some districts to meet. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokeswoman for the association, said whole-grain bread and buns generally aren’t a problem. But she said students complained about other items, in many cases because of cultural or regional preferences. Finding whole-grain biscuits and grits that students like are a challenge in the U.S. South, she said, while tortillas are a challenge in the Southwest.  Not everyone welcomed the relaxed rules. The American Heart Association encouraged schools to “stay the course” and commit to meeting the stricter standards that started going into effect in 2012. The Center for Science in the Public Interest also said the decision to roll back the whole-grain requirement makes no sense because most schools were already in compliance. Those still struggling to meet the standard would have eventually been able to comply as well, said Colin Schwartz, the center’s deputy director of legislative affairs. For the current school year, the USDA said 20 percent of schools were applying for exemptions to the whole-grain rule. Pasta, tortillas, biscuits and grits were the most commonly requested items for exemption, it said. The USDA school lunch program provides low-cost or free lunches in public schools and other institutions. Last year, it served an estimated 30 million children. Brandon Lipps, deputy undersecretary for the USDA’s food and nutrition division, said that at some schools that only serve whole grain foods, some is wasted if students won’t eat it. In those cases, schools might now consider other options, Lipps said. The USDA defines whole grain-rich foods as at least 50 percent whole grains.

Group pushes to end plastic foam use in schools,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) — Styrofoam is the single biggest contribution to cafeteria waste at Eastern Middle School, according to a group of parent volunteers who are trying to persuade the Board of Education to phase out single-use trays from lunch rooms. “I’d ask you to fund reusable wares and dishwashers in the upcoming year,” parent Julie DesChamps told the school board at a meeting Thursday. “By dedicating the necessary funds now, this board will make the necessary decision to provide environmental stewardship and provide for our students’ health.” Greenwich public school parents and students are rallying around the mantra, “healthier options on reusable trays,” as a town wide Food Services Committee, composed of parents, school and town officials, works to improve the menu in cafeterias and explore the option of outsourcing food production. Improving the food is a decades-old discussion and potential action item that resurfaced last fall. In response to calls from parents and the Board of Education, staff in the Food Services Department have made a number of changes, but the committee is figuring out the logistics and costs of larger-scale changes. PTA Health and Wellness Committee co-chair Nerlyn Pierson said the momentum to make substantive changes is gaining speed. “Any change will require unwavering commitment from the BOE and the BET,” Pierson told the school board. “Commit to make the changes necessary so all students are provided with healthy, nutritious food on nontoxic ware. This shouldn’t be a hollow commitment.”  Stephanie Chawla, the mother of a Glenville student and a physicians assistant, created a petition asking for better food and sustainable, eco-friendly food wares. Almost 600 people signed it in five days. In February, the school board discussed taking one school off the National School Lunch Program and outsourcing food production to No Fuss Lunch, a New Jersey-based company. Board members wanted to explore offers from other companies, too, preferably closer to Greenwich. Brigaid, a food service company that began in New London, proposed to consult with the district on ways to introduce more on-site cooking without going off the National School Lunch Plan. That would be necessary if a school were to outsource food preparation to No Fuss Lunch. Leaders of Brigaid also proposed working with the district at a lower cost, based on the growing movement in Greenwich to change food services, school board member Laura Rabin said. While the committee considers staying on the school lunch program or going off, and contracting with either Brigaid or No Fuss Lunch, it is also drafting a healthier menu, with help from volunteer nutritionists, the PTAC Wellness Committee and the Food Services Department, Rabin said. “This isn’t about dollars and cents, this is a moral issue,” said Abbe Large, a member of the Food Service Committee and the Representative Town Meeting. “And with the Styrofoam, it’s becoming a legal problem.” The call for waste reduction comes on the heels of a vote in the Environmental Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly in favor of legislation banning Styrofoam trays, which contain elements that could be harmful to students. “Embrace volunteers ... embrace change,” Large said. “We have to do something now because this topic is affecting students every single day.” Students have also joined the call to reduce waste. Styrene, a common compound in food containers, takes 500 years to break down, and is one of the top 10 materials found in litter along beaches, said Lina Thakor, a Greenwich High School student and member of the Environmental Action Club. “It deeply troubles me that Greenwich Public School uses Styrofoam,” Thakor told the school board. “Students at Greenwich Public Schools run the risk of ingesting chemicals every day, something they’re likely unaware of.” Districts larger than Greenwich have recognized the harmful effects of Styrofoam, and have made changes, she said. “We are a highly educated community that can afford to address issues such as this one,” she said. “Let’s be catalysts of change. I urge you to support the effort of finding an alternative.” While it is too late for the school board to request funding for reusable trays and dishwashers for the upcoming school year, the committee has started looking into metal tray options and the cost of equipping every school with a dishwasher — a request that could go before the board as an appropriation in the future. “We heard loud and clear about the dangers of Styrofoam,” Rabin said.

School district failed to file for food service funds,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire school district that’s struggled with unpaid student lunch bills has learned it failed to file for federal reimbursements for its food service program for two years. The Claremont district’s business and finance director said that oversight resulted in Claremont losing out on several hundred thousand dollars. Acting Superintendent Cory LeClair told the school board that filing for the National School Lunch program is supposed to be done before the start of the school year, but in 2018 it was not submitted until Jan. 30. This year, the filing was not completed until early February. LeClair said a food service program assistant has been hired who will be responsible for preparing and filing the multi-part application. The assistant’s also handling the district’s school lunch debt, about $20,000. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

How ‘lunch shaming’ is facing scrutiny around the US,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - In this Thursday, May 4, 2017 file photo, a third-grader punches in her student identification to pay for a meal at Gonzales Community School in Santa Fe, N.M. All students are offered the same lunch at Gonzales and other Santa Fe public schools to avoid any chance of embarrassing students whose parents may have fallen behind on meal payments. In April 2017, New Mexico became the first state to outlaw the shaming of children for any unpaid meals. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee) NEW YORK (AP) — Denying children a hot meal apparently isn’t a popular way for schools to deal with unpaid lunch money. After a flood of angry Facebook comments and phone calls, a Rhode Island district last week abandoned its plan to serve cold sandwiches to students whose families owe money. “The outcry was global,” said Catherine Bonang of Warwick Public Schools. Such practices aren’t new, but they are facing more scrutiny. As the push against “lunch shaming” gains traction, here’s what you should know: Previously, students in Warwick with unpaid charges were served cheese sandwiches that are not on the regular menu, which made it clear who owed money, Bonang said. The district was trying to make it less obvious by switching to sunflower butter and jelly sandwiches, since those are offered as a daily option to everyone, she said. But the backlash prompted officials to go further and say all students would get the choice of a hot meal. A policy of not letting older students with unpaid meal charges take part in activities like dances and field trips was also recently scrapped, the district said. It’s difficult to gauge the prevalence among the nation’s thousands of schools. But in 2011, a majority of districts surveyed said they had unpaid meal charges, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal school lunch program. Among those schools, serving alternative meals was common. Cheese or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were cited as alternatives. Districts also reported taking other actions to recover costs, such as withholding grades.  New Mexico passed a law against it in 2017, and several other states including California, Iowa and Oregon have followed suit. The laws generally prohibit practices like stamping students’ hands or making them do chores, though serving alternative meals isn’t always explicitly banned. The laws’ supporters say students should never go hungry at school or be shamed with food. Last month, federal lawmakers introduced “anti-lunch shaming” legislation to help shield children with unpaid charges. The USDA also discourages practices that stigmatize students, but lets districts set their own policies. A child can feel shame even if it’s not obvious to others why they’re getting a cold sandwich, said Jennifer Ramo of New Mexico Appleseed, which advocates against the practice. After forgetting to pay for lunches one week, Aniece Germain said her son was given a sun butter sandwich in kindergarten last year. She said her heart broke when she picked him up at school, and he asked why she hadn’t paid for him. She was also charged $2.50 for the sandwich, the same as for a hot meal. “So the purpose of that is to humiliate the kids, shame the kids, to get the parents to pay,” said Germain, who lives in Cranston, Rhode Island, not far from Warwick. Cranston’s school district said it no longer serves alternative meals. The national school lunch program serves around 30 million children. About 20 million of those students qualify for free lunches, and 2 million qualify for a reduced price lunch of 40 cents. The roughly 8 million remaining pay the regular price determined by local districts. Students with unpaid meal charges are the ones affected by lunch shaming. Even if families with unpaid charges could afford to pay, many say children shouldn’t be punished for their failure to do so. Reasons for unpaid charges can also vary. Some families may struggle to make ends meet, even if they’re not eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Others may feel there’s a stigma to applying, or not realize they qualify. In Warwick, the district said $12,000 of its $77,000 in unpaid charges is owed by children who qualified for free lunch, with charges incurred before their applications were approved. The School Nutrition Association, which represents cafeteria operators and suppliers, said providing free lunches for all students would end confusion about charges. The USDA report from a few years ago said lost revenue from unpaid meals tended to represent a tiny percentage of a school food program’s overall spending. But situations can vary, and the School Nutrition Association said unpaid charges are a widespread issue, with debt esca2lating in places that adopted anti-lunch shaming policies. In Maine, officials estimate the state’s new law will have unknown but “significant "" costs for local districts. In Cranston, where the debt is at about $90,000, officials in January started using a debt collector. Michael Crudale of Cranston Public Schools said simply getting a letter from a collection agency can sometimes get families to pay. “They feel like it’s been turned up a notch,” he said. He said credit scores aren’t affected, but that letters are sent every 30 days until the school year ends. At that point, Crudale said the district eats the cost and the debt is erased.

Meghan puts notes on bananas sent to needy women in Britain,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. LONDON (AP) — Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has written personal messages to women being helped by a charity that seeks to help sex workers break free from prostitution. Prince Harry’s wife took the unusual step of writing the messages on the skins of bananas destined for the food parcels that would be handed out to the women Friday. Meghan wrote sentiments such as “You are strong,” ’'You are special,” and “You are brave!” with hearts next to them. She was visiting the One25 organization in Bristol, southwest England. She said the messages were inspired after she learned of a program “this woman had started in the States on a school lunch program when on each of the bananas she wrote an affirmation or something to make the kids feel really empowered.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

‘Share tables’ keep unwanted lunch food out of trash,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WINTER PARK, Fla. (AP) — As 9-year-old Sabrina Agosto left her school’s lunch line, she dropped her carton of milk on the cafeteria’s “share and donation” table and then snagged an extra yogurt. “I don’t like milk,” explained the fourth grader at Aloma Elementary School in Orange County. “I really like them,” she said of her twin containers of strawberry yogurt. Lunchtime at Aloma means a steady stream of youngsters putting items they don’t want on the table and picking up extras of things they do like. On a recent afternoon, containers of milk and yogurt, wrapped cheese sticks, and packages of crackers, orange slices and coleslaw all came to and then left the table. Whatever isn’t picked up by students is donated to a nearby church that gives the food to the homeless. The 2-year-old effort aims to eliminate food waste and to provide extra nutrition both to hungrier kids in the cafeteria and to needy residents in the community. Aloma is one of about 20 public elementary schools in Orange that have started a so-called share table. Some, like Aloma, donate their excess to charities and others send the food — which cannot, by law, be reused in the lunch program — home with students whose families struggle to make ends meet. Most of Osceola County’s public elementary schools, and a few in Lake and Seminole counties, run share tables, too, though they don’t all send leftovers to charities.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal lunch program, endorsed “share tables” as an “innovative strategy” that food service directors should consider in a June 2016 memo. “Without this program, that would literally go in the dumpsters,” said Pastor Stan Reinemund of Redeemer Lutheran Church, about a mile from Aloma’s campus and the beneficiary of the school’s leftover food. Once a week, he picks up Aloma’s donations. His church puts some items in its food pantry and uses others for a Sunday breakfast served free to about 100 homeless people every week. “It really helps us out,” Reinemund said. Under the federal school lunch program, students must take a certain number of items as they go through the cafeteria line, including a fruit or vegetable. But students don’t always want everything they’ve had to take, said Lora Gilbert, senior director for food services at the Orange school district. The schools must also serve the same size meals to kindergartners, for whom the lunch may be too much, and to much-larger fifth graders, for whom it might not be quite enough, she said. The share table seeks to solve those problems without filling trash cans. Riley Wiggins, 9, dropped his orange slices on Aloma’s table “because I don’t like oranges.” But the fourth grader said that when carrots are on the menu, he sometimes grabs a second serving. Another Aloma student grabbed extra packages of oranges and coleslaw and a second cheese stick off the table, sat down and ate it all. Maybe, Gilbert said, he doesn’t get much at home, but at least at lunch he could eat plenty of nutritious food. “We don’t want to see any child hungry,” she added. The federal school lunch program provides free and reduced-price meals to youngsters in low-income families and allows others to purchase them, with lunch in an Orange elementary school costing $1.90. Under federal rules, schools with lots of youngsters from poor families also can opt to serve free meals to everyone, and that’s what Aloma and many other Orange schools do. Parent Shannon Miller, who volunteers in Aloma’s cafeteria about once a week, said her fourth-grade daughter often picks up an additional milk from the share table. She likes that the program means good food is “not just going in the trash.” Because of state health-code requirements, the share tables cannot accept hot food or food that isn’t in sealed containers, Gilbert said. But Aloma gets most of its food from one of the district’s central kitchens, so even fresh fruit usually arrives sliced and individually packaged. Those items can go on the table along with anything else that is sealed in its own container. Staff keeps cold items fresh with ice-pack-lined trays and a small refrigerator donated by the Winter Park Health Foundation. Martha Albright, Aloma’s cafeteria manager, said the share table has cut down on waste and mess in the lunch room because students don’t play with and then throw out food they don’t want to eat. “The custodians love it,” she said. “The share and donation table is just terrific,” added school board member Linda Kobert, “to serve our other students or to go back into the community.” Information from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Key departures signal agriculture shakeup for Capitol Hill,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - In this Feb. 27, 2019, file photo, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., asks a question on Capitol Hill in Washington. The reelection defeat of Peterson in Minnesota and some key retirements mean a shakeup is coming for the industry on Capitol Hill, with power likely to shift from the Midwest to the South and the coasts. Both the House and Senate agriculture committees will get new chairs, and there will be a new top Republican on the House panel. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The reelection defeat of U.S. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson in Minnesota and some key retirements mean a shakeup is coming for the industry on Capitol Hill, with power likely to shift from the Midwest to the South and the coasts. Both the House and Senate agriculture committees will get new chairs, and there will be a new top Republican on the House panel. Observers say the most likely replacements are expected to prioritize Southern crops such as peanuts, rice and cotton over traditional Midwest concerns of corn, soybeans, sugar beets and dairy. That could mean a new emphasis on nutrition programs that serve the poor. Peterson, a Democrat who lost his bid for a 16th term, was a major force in shaping several farm bills and a strong advocate for Midwestern agriculture in a House where the ranks of rural Democrats have been shrinking. He was known for working across the aisle, and he had Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s ear. “I don’t think you can in any way exaggerate the magnitude of the loss for agriculture,” said former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat whose name is in the mix as a potential agriculture secretary under President-elect Joe Biden. It will be hard to replace his institutional knowledge and his ability to win over liberals to deliver farm bills that work for Midwest agriculture, she said. Peterson lost to Republican Michelle Fischbach, a former lieutenant governor and state senator. Fischbach plans to seek a seat on the Agriculture Committee, but she’ll have to draw heavily on her legislative skills to have much of an influence as a freshman in the minority party.  Peterson didn’t respond to an interview request about his future plans; his spokeswoman said he was out deer hunting. But his name has been discussed within the farm policy world as a potential appointee to a ranking post in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, maybe even as secretary. “He was somebody who understood the details and minutiae of agricultural policy probably better than anyone in the country,” former U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. “He was a skilled negotiator, which you need to have to get farm bills through the process.” Vilsack, a Democratic former governor of Iowa, said Peterson’s departure will be “particularly difficult” for the sugar, biofuels and dairy industries. Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is the only one of the top four agriculture committee leaders returning in 2021. Republican Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas is expected to become the next chairman of the Senate committee, replacing Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas if the GOP retains control there. Neither Roberts nor Rep. Michael Conaway of Texas, the ranking Republican in the House committee, sought reelection. Peterson’s loss wasn’t a total surprise, given that his district has become much more Republican over the past decade. Agricultural interests spent heavily to try to keep him in power. Kevin Paap, president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau, said the contest remains “the most talked about political race to anybody involved in agriculture.” The departures of Peterson, Roberts and Conaway will cost the agriculture committees 85 years of collective farm policy experience, he said. The two most senior Democrats on the House panel, Reps. David Scott of Georgia and Jim Costa of California, both said last week that they’re running for the chairmanship. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, who has also been discussed as a potential agriculture secretary, has not publicly said whether she was interested in leading the committee. She champions nutrition programs and represents a mostly African American district that includes parts of Cleveland and Akron. Costa, who represents California farm country, and Scott, who represents part of Atlanta and several suburbs, indicated that they would emphasize the nutrition programs that fall under the committee’s purview, including SNAP, formerly known as food stamps; the Women, Infants and Children program; and the National School Lunch Program. They had less to say in their pitches to colleagues about crop subsidy and insurance programs that more directly affect farmers — an indicator of the changing priorities among House Democrats. Former U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, a Democrat from Indiana who served on the Senate committee, said both Scott and Costa have deep agricultural policy backgrounds and would be “strong advocates for farm country.” Their current emphasis on nutrition is because they’ll need votes from urban lawmakers to get elected chairman, he said. Less of a shift is expected on the Senate side, regardless of whether the GOP retains control there. Heitkamp, who also served on the committee, said she expects Boozman and Stabenow to work well together. Although Boozman represents Southern crops, Heitkamp said he also understands northern farm needs. While the leadership implications are important, crucial issues won’t change, said Craig Cox, senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources at the Environmental Working Group, which is critical of federal farm policy, contending that current subsidy and other programs foster unsustainable practices. Topping the list, he said, is “the urgent need to really take a hard look at crop subsidies and crop insurance,” and what those programs cost taxpayers. Other priorities should include addressing unjust treatment for Black farmers, the contamination of ground and surface water from fertilizer and manure, and agriculture’s role in the climate crisis. “The issues are issues regardless of who is occupying that chair,” Cox said.

USDA buying food from US farmers as food pantries struggle,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — When patrons of the food pantry at Harmony Community Baptist Church walk into the basement on Wednesday mornings, many are overwhelmed by the quality and quantity of the food they receive. “You’ve got the vegetables, you’ve got the fruits, you’ve got white potatoes,” said Michael Taylor, a resident who’s been coming to the pantry in Chicago’s west side Lawndale neighborhood for nearly a year. “And you’ve got the main course — the meat. It doesn’t get better than this.” Taylor said it feels good to be able to provide fresh milk and balanced meals for his kids. Since the USDA began buying meat, produce and dairy from U.S. farmers last fall, the food people receive from food pantries has been more fresh and more nutritious. But it’s also presented challenges for those who get the food from growers fields to the dinner tables that need it across the country. The first round of the USDA’s Trade Mitigation food purchase and distribution program was announced in August 2018, as a way of helping farmers hurt by the ongoing trade disputes with China, Mexico and other countries. As of June 12, the agency purchased $748 million of the promised $1.2 billion in food from U.S. producers, according to the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service. The nonprofit news outlet Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News.  An agency spokesperson said the remaining $450 million will be completed by January of 2020. The agency has promised an additional $1.3 billion in food purchases, but has not laid out a timeline for the additional buys. The majority of the food purchased through the USDA’s trade mitigation plan is destined for food banks and pantries, through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Some food may also be made available to The National School Lunch Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which primarily delivers food to elderly Americans and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. TEFAP has distributed an average of $540 million dollars’ worth of food each year since 2014. Adding the food purchased through the two trade mitigation programs will increase the annual average fivefold. The National School Lunch Program has purchased an average of $1.3 billion a year since 2014. Greg Trotter, the senior manager of public relations at the Greater Chicago Food Depository, said the organization received nearly double the food it normally received from the USDA in a year. The depository has received 22 million pounds of food from the USDA, up from 12 million pounds in 2018. “We’ve been just swimming in milk and apples this year. We’ve got boxes of apples up to the ceiling in our coolers,” said Trotter. “It’s definitely been a challenge, logistically, both for us and our partner agencies. But we still feel like it’s a net positive, on the whole.” Odice Anderson, one of the volunteers at Harmony Community Baptist Church, said for many of their patrons, the additional food has had other benefits. He remembers one woman’s reaction to the extra food. “She stood and cried and told her kids how much of a blessing it was. She said, ‘this month, we’ll pay the light bill.’” But getting that additional food home can present its own challenges. Diane Carioscio, food pantry coordinator at Harmony Community Baptist Church, said many patrons use public transportation to get to the pantry. Some have even turned down extra food, because getting it home on a train just isn’t feasible. “We had this one woman come through. The whole way she was like, ‘What a blessing, what a blessing! I’ve never gotten this much food before,’” said Carioscio. But an hour later, she said the woman was still outside, waiting on a ride. “She was in tears. She said, ‘I can’t get this home.’ She physically couldn’t get it,” said Carioscio. One of the volunteers helped her to the train, but the woman still had to get off the train and home. “We think of ourselves as the last mile, but sometimes they have a full mile to go, walking.” Ted Schroeder, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University said that, even though these purchases are not intended to displace food normally be purchased for government programs, it may be offsetting other food items for hungry Americans. “We aren’t simply eating more,” said Schroeder. “It’s just going to displace other food.” USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service said in an email that the trade mitigation purchases are not intended to replace normal food orders. “Many of the foods being offered under trade mitigation are not foods that USDA would normally offer through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP),” said a Food and Nutrition Service representative. Taylor said before the USDA was delivering meat and produce, he would take more beans and rice to keep his family fed. Trotter said the Greater Chicago Food Depository has expanded its cold storage in recent years, but it’s still had to rely on off-site storage for the USDA’s food deliveries. He worries that smaller food banks won’t be able to handle the influx of perishable food. Carioscio said the meat and milk have to be handed out the same day they’re delivered. They just don’t have the room to store it in the church’s basement. “If we have two crock pots on in the kitchen, we blow the circuit. So bringing in a large refrigerator to handle this just isn’t feasible,” she said. Trotter said his group recommended changes to the USDA on how they deliver the food. While it may be easier for the agency to deliver full gallons of milk, for the people who need the food, half gallons are more manageable. Food Depository officials also recommended the USDA order applesauce instead of fresh apples, so pantries can keep them longer without worrying about spoilage. “There are times where we’ve gotten three truckloads of apples in one week,” said Trotter. “Thirty-five thousand pounds of apples, and it’s not expected. When you add something like that to regular operations, it’s challenging.” Trotter said the Food Depository has been working with the USDA to get more notice before deliveries as well. As the agency has doubled the amount of food it plans to buy from farmers, food banks will be receiving a surplus of food for at least another year, even if trade deals are reached. He hopes the USDA will take feedback from food pantries and distribution centers and improve future deliveries. “There could be lessons learned on both sides,” said Trotter. “It could be good for farmers and food banks.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Rollback proposed for Michelle Obama school lunch guidelines,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - In this Thursday, May 4, 2017 file photo, a third-grader punches in her student identification to pay for a meal at Gonzales Community School in Santa Fe, N.M. The Trump administration is proposing a rollback of nutrition guidelines for federal school meals programs that had been promoted by Michelle Obama as part of her campaign to combat child obesity. (AP Photo/Morgan Lee, file) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday took another step toward dismantling Michelle Obama’s school nutrition guidelines, proposing a new rule that could lead to more pizza and fries and less fruit and a smaller variety of vegetables on school menus. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who announced the rule changes on Obama’s birthday, said they were needed to give schools more flexibility and reduce waste while still providing nutritious and appetizing meals. But child nutrition advocates saw it differently. “What a shameless, embarrassing capitulation to lobbyists at the expense of American children and their well-being,” said Sam Kass, who served as executive director of Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign to combat child obesity. ”This country — and its kids — deserve so much better. “ Under the proposal, schools would be allowed to cut the amount of certain types of vegetables served at lunch, and legumes offered as a meat alternative also could be counted as part of the vegetable requirement. Potatoes could be served as a vegetable. The proposal also would allow schools to reduce the amount of fruit at on-the-go breakfast served outside the cafeteria. Gay Anderson, president of the School Nutrition Association, said that while the nutrition standards had been a success overall, some requirements led to reduced participation in the program, higher costs and waste.  “USDA’s school meal flexibilities are helping us manage these challenges and prepare nutritious meals that appeal to diverse student tastes,” Anderson said in a statement. The school meals program serves about 30 million students, most of them from low-income families. “The Trump administration’s assault on children’s health continues today under the guise of ‘simplifying’ school meals,” Colin Schwartz, the Center for Science in the Public Interest’s deputy director for legislative affairs, said in a statement. The proposal would give schools greater flexibility in offering entrees for a la carte purchases, which Schwartz said would “create a huge loophole in school nutrition guidelines, paving the way for children to choose pizza, burgers, French fries, and other foods high in calories, saturated fat or sodium in place of balanced school meals every day.” Geraldine Henchy, director of nutrition policy at the Food Research & Action Center, said the bottom line should be nutrition, but the revisions to the a la carte rule would result in students getting “a lot more fats, a lot more sodium, a lot more calories.” Specifically, the proposal would reduce the amount of red and orange vegetables that would have to be offered every day at lunch. For breakfasts taken to go, fruit servings could be reduced from a cup to half a cup. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat and chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, said the proposal “threatens the progress we’ve made toward improving nutrition in schools.” “For many children, the food they eat at school is their only access to healthy, nutritious meals,” he said. The American Heart Association said the rule would “put children’s health at risk.” “Healthy school meals help combat childhood obesity and poor cardiovascular health, but they also help establish a foundation for a lifetime of healthy behaviors,” the group said. As first lady, Obama championed healthier school meals as part of the “Let’s Move” campaign. “With one in three of our kids on track to have diabetes, it’s unconscionable that the Trump administration would do the bidding of the potato and junk food industries,” Kass said. The 2010 Health, Hunger-Free Kids Act set nutrition standards for school meals, requiring schools to offer fruits and vegetables and more whole-grain foods and to limit calories, fat and sodium. The proposed rule is the second move by the Trump administration to scale back the school lunch program’s nutrition standards. Under a 2018 rule, the administration reduced the whole grains that had to be served and allowed low-fat chocolate milk. Before the rule change, only fat-free flavored milk was permitted. Perdue announced the proposed changes in San Antonio, Texas. “Schools and school districts continue to tell us that there is still too much food waste and that more common-sense flexibility is needed to provide students nutritious and appetizing meals,” he said. The agency also proposed changes to the summer meals program, which serves 2.6 million children. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump rule may mean 1 million kids lose automatic free lunch,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - In this Wednesday, July 10, 2019 file photo, 6-year-old elementary school students go through the lunch line in the school’s cafeteria in Paducah, Ky. Nearly a million students could lose their automatic eligibility for free school lunches under a Trump administration proposal that’s expected to reduce the number of people who get food stamps. In October 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has released an analysis finding as many as 982,000 children could be affected by the change. (Ellen O’Nan/The Paducah Sun via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Nearly a million children could lose their automatic eligibility for free school lunches under a Trump administration proposal that would reduce the number of people who get food stamps. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has released an analysis that says as many as 982,000 children could be affected by the change. About half would have to pay a reduced price of 40 cents for school lunch and 30 cents for breakfast. Around 40,000 would need to pay the full price, which varies depending on the district. The rest — 445,000 — would remain eligible for free meals, but their families would have to apply to qualify. Children automatically qualify for free lunches if their families receive food stamps, but the Trump administration has proposed tightening eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which was once known as food stamps. The USDA is not proposing changes to the income rules for the program. It says it is addressing a loophole that gives eligibility to people who would not have otherwise qualified. The agency said the vast majority of affected children would still be eligible for either free or reduced-price meals. But Lisa Davis of the advocacy group No Kid Hungry said the application to qualify could be a barrier. “We hear from schools all the time about the challenge they have with getting families to understand the paperwork or to get it back,” Davis said.  The National School Lunch Program serves roughly 30 million students, including about 20 million free meals daily. For those who don’t qualify for free or reduced price meals, the average price of lunch was $2.48 for elementary school students in the 2016-17 school year, according to the School Nutrition Association, which represents cafeteria employees and vendors. The group says about three-quarters of school districts have students with unpaid meal charges. The prevalence of school lunch debt shows even small amounts of money can add up over time and become a burden to struggling families, said Giridhar Mallya, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Earlier this year, a Rhode Island district at the center of a controversy around “lunch shaming "" — singling out students who owe lunch money — said $12,000 of its $77,000 in unpaid meal charges were owed by children who qualified for free lunches. The district said the charges were incurred before the families’ applications were approved. In details released late Monday, the USDA said its proposal could cut $90 million a year from the cost of its school lunch and breakfast programs, which last year was more than $18 billion. It noted the actual number of children who could lose automatic access to free lunch could be less, since some schools offer free lunches to all students regardless of their eligibility. But those schools do so under a program that requires 40% of students to be eligible for free meals, and the rule change could mean some schools no longer meet that threshold, Mallya said. The USDA released the details of its analysis after it was criticized for failing to report the impact its SNAP rule change could have on children’s access to free school meals. The agency has said the change is intended to make eligibility rules more consistent across the country, since states can grant people eligibility if they were enrolled in other assistance programs. The USDA said it would reopen the public comment period on the rule for two weeks to allow feedback on the estimated impact to school meals.

Cafeteria worker says she lost job for giving boy free lunch,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire school cafeteria worker’s kindness may have got her fired. Bonnie Kimball tells the Valley News she was terminated March 28 by her employer, a vendor that supplies food to the Mascoma Valley Regional High School in Canaan. It came a day after she gave a student lunch, even though he couldn’t pay for it. Kimball says that when the student’s account showed no funds, she quietly told him “‘tell (your) mom you need money,’” and provided a lunch. She claims a manager just asked what was on the boy’s plate and walked away. “It was my life for five years. I went and I took care of another family,” Kimball told the newspaper. “You don’t just lose a family member, be OK and move on.” A spokeswoman for Manchester-based Cafe Services said in a statement Thursday it “would never authorize an employee to not feed a student or staff member a meal.” The spokeswoman would only say an employee “would not be let go because they provided this lunch to a student.” “Although we are not at liberty to discuss the confidential details regarding an employee’s employment or termination from employment, we can share that the company has policies and procedures in place that are shared with and acknowledged by team members,” Jaime Matheson, the director of human resources, said in a statement. “When established policies and procedures are not followed corrective action is put in place up to and including termination.” The incident comes as schools across the country are struggling to deal with how to address students who can’t pay for their lunch . A 2011 survey found that a majority of district had unpaid lunch charges and that most dealt with it by offering students alternatives meals.  But even that approach has been controversial. After a flurry of angry Facebook posts, one Rhode Island district was forced to abandon plans to deny a hot meal to students who couldn’t pay. Last month, federal lawmakers also introduced “anti-lunch shaming” legislation to protect students with unpaid lunch bills. The USDA also discourages practices that stigmatize students, but allows districts to set their own policies. The Valley News reports that the alleged firing has angered Kimball’s co-workers, some of whom quit in protest. Parents at the school also said they were upset by Kimball’s sudden departure and demanded she be rehired. “These guys really took care of our kids. They put our kids first and their focus was really our kids,” said Christina Moodie, whose son attends the high school. “I know Bonnie went above and beyond for the kids.” The Mascoma Regional School Board voted Tuesday to continue using the company for another year, despite the controversy involving Kimball. “The people working in the school lunch program are employees of Café Services, and Café Services is responsible for employment decisions regarding those employees,” the district said in a statement. “School district policy is to make healthy nutritious school meals available to every child whether or not the child has sufficient funds to cover the cost of the meal.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) — When Jose Andres first came to New York City, the wide-eyed sailor in the Spanish navy docked on West 30th Street full of ambition. Decades later, the award-winning chef has an upscale food hall on that very street and will serve 40,000 meals this week across the city where he built his dreams, and which is now the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus. Andres, whose restaurants in the United States include The Bazaar, Jaleo and the two Michelin-starred Somni, founded World Central Kitchen in 2010. It has served over 15 million meals worldwide after hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters. Since the pandemic, his organization has served more than 750,000 meals from Miami and Los Angeles to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Fairfax, Virginia. It works out of places like libraries, food trucks and shuttered restaurants, feeding 125 hospitals, students in school lunch programs and even quarantined cruise ship passengers. Andres has amassed an A-list network around the world, relying on celebrity chef pals including Rachael Ray, Guy Fieri and Marcus Samuelsson to feed the hungry and buoy the humble restaurant kitchens across America where many started their careers. “I’m in debt to America. ... That’s the best I can give to America because America gave me a home. America gave me opportunity,” Andres told The Associated Press in a recent phone interview.  In New York City, he set up a cafe to serve the Mount Sinai field hospital in Central Park. In Harlem, he’s using “Chopped” TV judge Samuelsson’s Red Rooster restaurant to feed families. Samuelsson’s Miami restaurant hasn’t opened to the public yet, but instead of leaving it empty, he turned it over to World Central Kitchen. They are serving sandwiches and salads there to laid-off hospitality workers, homeless residents and Uber drivers. Even in crisis, these top chefs aren’t serving bland porridge. Recent meals at senior centers in Washington, D.C., included creamy tomato pasta with spring vegetables, and cilantro rice bowls with spiced chickpeas and spinach topped with citrus vinaigrette and crispy tortillas. Andres was among the first to close his restaurants, hoping to create a blueprint for chefs around the world on how to use their restaurants and employ workers while feeding the hungry. “This operation is growing every day,” he said. “We want to put America to work in the process of feeding America.” In California, Fieri is on standby, ready with a 48-foot-long (15-meter-long) rescue kitchen and support team. “Guy is ready to go,” Andres said. “This is like war. You need to have troops ready for action.” Fieri compared his longtime friendship with Andres and other famous chefs to “playing in a band.” “When you hang out with generous, philanthropist warlords like Jose Andres, all you want to do is go bigger, go better,” said Fieri, who cooked alongside Andres during last year’s California wildfires. In the early days of the outbreak, Fieri, the TV host of “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” also wanted to do more. He bought $50,000 in gift cards to support local restaurants. He sent dozens of personalized videos to CEOs from big food companies seeking donations. His Restaurant Employee Relief Fund quickly raised $10 million, with a goal of raising $100 million, to offer $500 grants for laid-off workers. The first checks were handed out last week. “As diners, we’re always the ones asking restaurants for help. … We ask the servers to take special care of our tables, the bartenders to listen to our stories and the bussers to clean up our messes,” Fieri said. He described the program as “a big warm blanket, as if to say, ‘Hey, we got you. It’s our turn to help you for once.’” Ray announced a $4 million donation Tuesday from her two charities. Half will go to feeding and nutritional programs, including World Central Kitchen. The other half will support animal rescue, feeding and veterinary programs. “We are not a disaster relief fund by origin or desire but that’s what we’ve become quite frankly in the last couple of years,” she told the AP in a phone interview. Andres’ organization is one of the largest recipients. “He’s just there around the clock all over the planet and I love Jose. I’m so devoted to him,” Ray said from her home in upstate New York. In Minnesota, Chef Andrew Zimmern was among the first there to shutter his restaurants, fearing for his workers’ safety. Next, he cobbled together the Independent Restaurant Coalition, hiring lobbyists to be a voice in Washington for restaurants, especially mom-and-pop ones. He noted that such restaurants are many people’s first jobs, as teens, and are top employers of single moms and those transitioning from prison. “We can’t fail. (Restaurants) have to be open and ready to welcome their workers back,” said Zimmern. “If we can’t do that, it will be an economic and humanitarian cultural catastrophe.” This story has been edited to clarify that Jose Andres was among the first chefs to close restaurants in the U.S., not Spain.

Farm loans and disaster assistance programs will also be on hold. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File ) WASHINGTON (AP) — The end of 2018 seemed to signal good things to come for America’s farmers. Fresh off the passage of the farm bill, which reauthorized agriculture, conservation and safety net programs, the Agriculture Department last week announced a second round of direct payments to growers hardest hit by President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. Then parts of the government shut down. The USDA in a statement issued last week assured farmers that checks would continue to go out during the first week of the shutdown. But direct payments for farmers who haven’t certified production, as well as farm loans and disaster assistance programs, will be put on hold beginning next week, and won’t start up again until the government reopens. There is little chance of the government shutdown ending soon. Trump and Congress are no closer to reaching a deal over his demand for border wall money, and both sides say the impasse could drag well into January. Although certain vital USDA programs will remain operational in the short term, that could change if the shutdown lasts for more than a few weeks. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, helps feed roughly 40 million Americans. According to the USDA, eligible recipients are guaranteed benefits through January. Other feeding programs, including WIC, which provides food aid and nutrition counseling for pregnant women, new mothers and children, and food distribution programs on Indian reservations, will continue on a local level, but additional federal funding won’t be provided. School lunch programs will continue through February.  USDA has earmarked about $9.5 billion in direct payments for growers of soybeans, corn, wheat, sorghum and other commodities most affected by tariffs. The first round of payments went out in September. The deadline to sign up for the second round of payments is January 15. The impact of the shutdown, which began shortly before most federal workers were scheduled for a holiday break, started coming into focus by midweek. About 420,000 employees are working without pay, while 380,000 are being forced to stay home. In the past, federal employees have been paid retroactively. But government contractors won’t get paid for hours they’ll lose staying home, causing problems for those who rely on hourly wages. In anticipation of the financial bind many federal workers and contractors may soon find themselves in, the Office of Personnel Management offered some advice: haggle with landlords, creditors and mortgage companies for lower payments until the shutdown is over. The shutdown also is affecting national parks, although unevenly: Some remain accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some are operating with money from states or charitable groups, while others are locked off.

USDA To Provide Meals For Kids This Summer,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. A U.S. Department of Agriculture program will provide free, nutrition meals to children again this summer. Last year, Pennsylvania children received more than five million meals from approximately 2,600 food program sites, with $14 million in USDA support, according to a press release. Many students who receive free or reduced cost meals during the school year through the School Breakfast and National School Lunch programs, lack access to healthy and nutritious food during the summer months and are at risk of hunger. Limited access to nutritious food during the summer can have an impact on learning all year long and can make students more susceptible to illness and other health issues. “Although the school year is ending, food insecurity for our students is a concern that the department has year-round,” said Pedro A. Rivera, secretary of the state Department of Education, which administers the program. “The Summer Food Service Program not only provides young students with a reliable and nutritious meal but will also improve at-risk students’ overall health and well-being.” There are several ways to find a participating summer meal site: • Call the “211” phone number for the United Way’s national call center. • “1-866-3Hungry” or “1-877-8Hambre” to find the place and time of free meals. • Log onto www.fns.usda.gov/summerfoodrocks for locations and times where free meals are to be served. • Text “FOOD” to “877877” to find out the nearest SFSP site near your location. • Log onto www.rangeapp.org for an app that can to locate places and times where free meals are served. — BILL WELLOCK Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Humble ISD is transitioning to a completely digital process when it comes to applying for free and reduced-priced meals for the 2018-2019 school year. This service offers free or reduce-priced meals to students who qualify as per the National School Lunch Program. It is important for families to take note of the move to online applications, explains an Humble ISD press release, because “It is urgent that families set up a School Café account (at www.schoolcafe.com).” Families that are unable to apply electronically and require a paper application option may obtain one at the district’s Child Nutrition Center — 1705 Wilson Road, Building D. Applications for free or reduced-price meals can be submitted at any point during the school year. Free/Reduced-price meal eligibility criteria include, but are not limited to: · Children living in a household that uses the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program · Children living in a household that uses the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families · Children living in a household that uses the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations · Foster children under state or court care · Children living in a household in which a member becomes unemployed · Children living in a household with an income that falls within the requirements of the Federal Income Guidelines. Income eligibility guidelines can be found at http://www.squaremeals.org/Publications/IncomeEligibilityGuidelines.aspx#CACFP  Additionally, Humble ISD urges parents and guardians to keep up with the balance in their kids’ meal account. Once there are no remaining funds in the account, the child can still get full meals up to a negative $20 limit. “Once a student’s account reaches -$20, the student will receive an alternate breakfast and/or lunch at no cost,” states the press release. Parents will be contacted through School Messenger emails when a student’s account has no remaining funds. Additional alerts options are available through School Café. Deposits can be made to students’ meal accounts at the school or online through School Café. For more information, visit www.humbleisd.net/childnutrition.

"6 states, DC sue over changes to school lunch rules","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) — Six states and the District of Columbia sued the Department of Agriculture on Wednesday, saying it weakened nutritional standards in school breakfasts and lunches when it relaxed the requirements affecting salt and refined grains last year. The lawsuit in Manhattan federal court asked a judge to overturn the changes, saying they were carried out in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The government “significantly weakened” nutritional standards for sodium and whole grains, according to the lawsuit, without giving the public a chance to comment on them and in opposition to nutritional requirements for school meals set by Congress. The states and D.C. said the standards should be based on recommendations of the U.S. government’s “Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” the National Academy of Sciences and scientific research regarding children’s nutrition. The USDA school lunch program provides low-cost or free lunches and breakfasts in public schools and other institutions. Last year, it served an estimated 30 million children. An email seeking comment was sent to the Justice Department. New York Attorney General Letitia James led the multistate civil legal action, saying in a release that over a million children in New York depend daily on the meals. “The Trump Administration has undermined key health benefits for our children — standards for salt and whole grains in school meals — with deliberate disregard for science, expert opinion, and the law,” she said.  The other plaintiffs are California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Mexico, Vermont and the District of Columbia. The lawsuit was filed after the Trump administration late last year scaled back contested school lunch standards implemented under the Obama administration, including one requiring that only whole grains be served. At the time of the reversal, the Department of Agriculture said it wanted to reduce bureaucracy that required schools to get special waivers in order to serve select refined grains foods. The changes made by the Trump administration also permitted low-fat chocolate milk to be served again where only fat-free milk had been permitted to be flavored. The department has said 20% of schools last year applied for exemptions to the whole-grain rule, most frequently so they could serve pasta, tortillas, biscuits and grits. The 2018 changes still required schools to reduce sodium in foods in stages, but they eliminated a final target for reduced sodium. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco, File) MIAMI (AP) — Even in a pandemic, there’s no slowdown for swindlers in Latin America. From Argentina to Panama, a number of officials have been forced to resign as reports of fraudulent purchases of ventilators, masks and other medical supplies pile up. The thefts are driven by price-gouging from manufacturers and profiteering by politically connected middlemen who see the crisis as an opportunity for graft. “Whenever there’s a dire situation, spending rules are relaxed and there’s always someone around looking to take advantage to make a profit,” said José Ugaz, a former Peruvian prosecutor who jailed former President Alberto Fujimori and was chairman of Transparency International from 2014-17. Coronavirus clusters are still spreading in Latin America, fueling a spike in deaths, swamping already-precarious hospitals and threatening to ravage slumping economies. Against this backdrop, reports of fraud have proliferated. On Tuesday, police in Rio de Janeiro raided the governor’s residence as part of a widening probe into the alleged embezzlement of part of the $150 million in public funds earmarked for building field hospitals. In Colombia, 14 of 32 governors are under investigation for crimes ranging from embezzlement to unlawfully awarding no-bid contracts. In Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires, prosecutors are probing a politically connected crony for buying 15,000 N95 surgical masks that, despite having expired, cost the city 10 times their listed price.  Perhaps the biggest fallout is in Bolivia, where the health minister was arrested amid allegations that 170 ventilators were bought at inflated prices. The breathing machines were purchased for nearly $28,000 each. But their Spanish manufacturer said it sold them to a distributor for only 6,000 euros ($6,500). Making matter worse, the machines aren’t suitable for longer-term care. The probe threatens to derail the presidential candidacy of interim leader Jeanine Anez. She assumed power in November, promising a clean break from 13 years of leftist rule by Evo Morales, who resigned amid vote-rigging allegations. Similar accusations of over-billing have shaken Panama, where a top aide to President Laurentino Cortizo quit and his vice president is under pressure to resign after prosecutors last month began investigating the planned purchase of 100 ventilators at nearly $50,000 each.   In Brazil, which has the world’s second-highest number of confirmed cases, police in one state created a task force to investigate pandemic-related crimes. Its nickname, “Corona Jato,” is a nod to the region’s biggest recent corruption scandal, the “Lava Jato,” or “Car Wash,” probe that uncovered billions stolen from state-run companies. Tuesday’s surprise search of the governor’s mansion and 10 other addresses in Rio has rattled Brazil’s political establishment because Gov. Wilson Witzel is a fierce critic of President Jair Bolsonaro, accusing him of undermining state measures to fight the virus. Witzel denied any wrongdoing and accused Bolsonaro of ordering the raid as political retribution. To be sure, disasters breed corruption all over the world, not just in Latin America. Spain, Italy and other countries also have been rocked by revelations of impropriety during the pandemic. In the U.S., an estimated  16% of $1 billion in aid spent after Hurricane Katrina was lost in potentially fraudulent payments. In one example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency paid one individual rental assistance as well as $8,000 to stay 70 nights at a hotel — in Hawaii. But stealing state funds is especially vexing in Latin America because of gaping poverty and a tattered social safety net. More than half its workers toil in the informal sector without health care or social security. “That’s the real scandal,” said Argentine writer Martín Caparrós, co-editor of a book about the region’s most shameless stories of graft called “We Lost: Who Won the Americas Cup of Corruption?” (Spoiler alert: An Argentine vice president convicted of buying a stake in a money-printing company while overseeing its bankruptcy proceedings was voted the worst offender by readers). Acceptance of corruption dates to the Spanish conquest, when powerful viceroys gave extensive land holdings to friends, and forgiveness of sins could literally be bought from the Roman Catholic church, Caparrós said. Roberto de Michele, the top transparency expert at the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank, disagrees, saying that even in normal conditions, an estimated 10% to 25% of global spending on health care is lost to corruption — hundreds of billions of dollars every year. But abuse multiplies in emergencies like natural disasters. He said the risks are even higher in the pandemic, as officials compete for limited supplies, disrupting established price mechanisms. “If you don’t stop at the red light, and nothing happens, or you can bribe the policeman and get away with it, then more people will have incentives not to stop at the red light,” said de Michele. “That’s institutional design, not culture.” Latin America countries consistently rank among the most corrupt. The latest survey  by Berlin-based Transparency International found that more than half of the region’s residents think the problem is getting worse, with 1 in 5 admitting to paying a bribe to public officials in the past year. Scandals involving officials caught stealing from school lunch programs, passing briefcases full of cash or placing lovers in cushy jobs are frequently in the news. Still, de Michele is optimistic that social pressure will bring change. A turning point came in 2016, when Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht admitted to paying $788 million in bribes across Latin America over more than a decade. That led to the jailing of former presidents in Peru and Brazil. Technology can also help protect state funds, de Michele said. He cited Paraguay, which unveiled a platform  allowing users to track in almost real time the status of 110 emergency contracts worth $26 million in spending tied to COVID-19. Finance Minister Benigno López said the platform will empower citizen groups to monitor how resources are spent. “The solution to corruption is punitive justice,” López told The Associated Press. “But at least this tool puts all public officials on notice that our actions will be under the microscope.”   —- Follow Goodman on Twitter: @APJoshGoodman —- Associated Press writers David Biller in Rio de Janeiro, Carlos Valdez in La Paz, Bolivia, Kathia Martinez in Panama City, Franklin Briceno in Lima, Peru, Christine Armario in Bogota and Almudena Calatrava in Buenos Aires, Argentina contributed.

Lawmakers push for federal nutrition bill for Native youth,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A group of Democratic senators and representatives are pushing for federal legislation that would allow for tribes to administer free federal food and nutrition programs to school children. U.S. Sen. Tom Udall and U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both of New Mexico, are among the bill’s sponsors. Udall’s office said Friday that the lawmakers were reintroducing the Tribal Nutrition Improvement Act, saying it would improve prospects that Native American children would have better access to nutritional foods. Under the bill, tribes would not be required to go through state agencies to administer the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, the Summer Food Service Program, and the Child and Adult Care Food Program.

Bill seeks to halt ‘lunch shaming’ in Iowa schools,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Lawmakers signed off on a bill Monday that will prevent Iowa students from being treated unfairly by school officials if their parents owe lunch money. Under the bill, Iowa schools would be prohibited from so-called “lunch shaming” tactics, including publicly identifying students whose parents owe money or throwing away meals that were already served. Schools would be allowed to accept private donations to pay off individual students’ debts. Many students receive free meals through the federal school lunch program. However, Iowa schools aren’t required to serve meals to other students whose parents don’t qualify for free meals. School policies vary on whether those students still receive meals. The bill passed both chambers of the Legislature unanimously and now goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for her signature. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

What’s on school menus this fall? Trade mitigation,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) — School lunch menus already have Meatless Mondays and Taco Tuesdays. Now some may get Trade Mitigation Thursdays. This fall, some U.S. school cafeterias are expecting shipments of free food, one little known consequence of President Donald Trump’s trade disputes. The products are coming from the Department of Agriculture, which is giving away the $1.2 billion in foods it’s buying to help farmers hurt by trade negotiations. A Maryland district is awaiting a truckload of canned kidney beans — one of several “trade mitigation” items schools were offered. “We make our own chili soup, so we knew we had a use for that,” said Barbara Harral, a nutrition official for Montgomery County Public Schools. All told, she said the district is getting $70,000 worth of free products for the fall, including apples and oranges. Harral, who has been with the district for 22 years, doesn’t recall the USDA offering trade mitigation foods before. The USDA has long purchased and distributed agricultural products to help farmers, who can face swings in supply and demand in any given year. But the agency is buying even more as a result of Trump’s trade fight, which prompted other countries to take retaliatory actions that curb imports of American farm products. That’s resulting in an unusual bounty for the groups that get government foods, showing one way federal policies influence what people eat.  According to the USDA, most food purchased as part of trade-relief efforts is going to programs that help the needy. The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, for instance, says it’s getting roughly twice as much government food as normal, including rarely donated items like pistachios. Though they may struggle to handle the sudden deluge, food banks say they’re generally happy for the bounty. The USDA says schools are only getting a tiny slice of trade mitigation foods, accounting for a majority of the $27 million of products ordered for child nutrition programs. But at a national convention for school cafeteria employees this summer, agency officials noted the program is expected to continue with additional items. Already, schools are entitled to annual allotments of USDA foods based on how many students they serve through the national school lunch program. But cafeteria officials who operate on tight budgets say they have always welcomed the “bonus” foods the agency offered in the past, even if the market forces that make the products available isn’t always clear. One year, they recall there was bonus almond butter, long before it was popular. Another year, there were frozen catfish pieces. “At the time, we didn’t have a way to use them,” Harral of Montgomery County said of the catfish. In the last couple years, the USDA said it hasn’t really offered bonus foods to schools, instead diverting them to programs for the needy. That’s making the trade mitigation items that much more of a treat for school food officials. “The room lights up when everyone knows we’ve got new items that are coming,” said Scott Clements, director of child nutrition at the Mississippi education department, which ordered two truckloads of trade mitigation pulled pork and four loads of kidney beans. Still, putting bonus foods to use can be tricky for schools, which plan menus far in advance and have to consider factors like procurement contracts and warehouse capacities. Such limitations are likely why schools didn’t take full advantage of the $100 million in trade mitigation foods they were offered for the fall, according to the USDA. In Alaska, officials only ordered a half truck of free kidney beans. “There’s only so many ways you can use them,” said Sue Lampert, a school food official for the state.

Blocker the clear choice to head Agriculture,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Republican voters have a very clear choice for agriculture commissioner of Texas. They can stick with incumbent Sid Miller, who has been mired in unnecessary controversy and dramatically raised fees on industry. Or they can choose a new direction. We recommend Trey Blocker, a lobbyist from Fredericksburg, wants to restore ethics and integrity to the Agriculture Department. Jim Hogan, a former dairy farmer from Cleburne, is also on the ballot. But Hogan ran as a Democrat last election and refuses to campaign. Blocker is a solid conservative, which is reflected in his ideas to streamline the agency and make government smaller but also more efficient. He has said he would immediately lower the fees Miller has instituted, fees that generated a $6.5 million surplus for the Department of Agriculture. He also has advocated for moving certain programs out of the Agriculture Department. The department oversees the federal school lunch program, for example, and Blocker said he believes a better place for that program would be the state’s Health and Human Services Commission. The department also oversees weights and measures, monitoring gas pumps and scales at grocery stores. Blocker believes this service belongs with Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Miller’s tenure at the Agriculture Department has been defined by self-serving actions and foolish controversies.  Let’s run through the lowlights. Miller has unnecessarily raised fees to bloat his department. The Texas Farm Bureau opposed those fee increases, citing the hit to industry. Miller has also used his office for bizarre personal benefit, initially using taxpayer funds to obtain a “Jesus Shot” in Oklahoma as well as attend a rodeo in Mississippi. He paid taxpayers back, but only after the trips were reported in the media. Early in his tenure, Miller briefly appointed the wife of a longtime political consultant to assistant commissioner of the Agriculture Department where her salary was $180,000. She has since resigned. He has also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on staff bonuses. He also sought to poison wild hogs with warfarin, which could potentially kill other animals and even humans, and he pushed to bring deep fryers back into schools over the objections of numerous districts and health experts. Voters in this primary can stick with Miller, or they can go with Blocker. Blocker, far and away, is the best choice. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Senators: Federal purchase to help NY concord grape growers,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Concord grape growers in New York are getting a boost from the federal government, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture planning to buy juice for nutrition programs. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand say the USDA will use up to $18 million to purchase surplus grape juice, which will help stabilize prices farmers receive. The senators say the purchase is good news for growers in the Finger Lakes, western New York and central New York. Purchases of concord grape juice have helped stabilize their market in the past.

"Schools to continue universal free breakfast, lunch","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HUNTINGTON — After another successful year, Cabell County Schools will once again offer universal free breakfast and lunch to its students. For the past two school years, the county has provided free breakfast and lunch to all students, regardless of the child’s family income, thanks to U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Community Eligibility Provision. More than 2 million meals were served last school year and the rate of students eating meals at school rose from 65 percent to 76 percent, said Mary Neely, president of the Cabell County Board of Education, on Thursday. “Thanks to this program, we know not one student in Cabell County went hungry during the school day,” Neely said. The announcement came during a celebration of the county’s Summer Food Service Program, which provided more than 30,000 meals to students and their families. “We feel extremely blessed and humbled that we have been granted the ability to provide meals for many children who might otherwise go hungry during the summer months,” said Superintendent Ryan Saxe. Funded through a partnership with the USDA, the summer meal program provides breakfast and lunch at most of the 40-plus sites and lunch at all. At three of the Title I schools, a cook was hired to provide hot meals. At the remainder of the sites, breakfast items and bagged lunches were delivered. About 1,100 were served a day. With the help of two cooks, two bus drivers and a coordinator, most of the bagged lunches are prepared by high school students.  “For many of these students, this is their first job so this is an opportunity to help prepare them for life by teaching them you are supposed to be at work on time, what it’s like to get a check and understand where that money comes from,” said program coordinator Joe Thacker. Studies show that proper nutrition leads to students performing better in school. A study commissioned by the school board showed just eating breakfast impacts a student’s ability to concentrate, their energy levels and their memory, along with reducing the number of sick days and generally making them perform better. The meals impact the students in another way as well: showing someone cares enough to prepare them a meal. When asked to speak on how her summer meals make her feel, third-grader Camryn Thompson chose instead to talk about one of her cooks. “I think Miss Bev is a great cook because she cooks great food and all the food she cooks is great,” Thompson said before giving Miss Bev a big hug.

State needs groups to feed hungry kids this summer,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The state of Maine is looking for groups to help feed kids this summer. The Department of Education says that last year 119 groups helped sponsor the school lunch program and provided an average of 12,182 lunches per day to children. About 700 more meals were served each day last year than in 2015, but the Department of Education says there’s still a long way to go. The summer food program is allowed in areas of the state where more than 50 percent of kids are eligible for free- or reduced-meal benefits. The Department of Education is accepting applications starting this month for sponsors, who will be reimbursed for eligible meals.

Connecticut Democrats are stuckIf I were to ever write a column for a newspaper in Connecticut, I’d like it to be entitled “Wait…What?” simply because the Connecticut legislature, especially the Democrats, never cease to amaze me with their convoluted Soviet-style grandiose plans.“Tax Breaks Eyed For College Grads” was on the front page of a recent Connecticut Post, above the fold.Apparently the Democrats realize that their tax burdens on the citizens and students of Connecticut are overly burdensome and are causing college graduates to leave Connecticut. These taxes are also causing citizens and companies (think General Electric, et al) to leave this state.So they’re proposing an incentive to stay in Connecticut by cutting taxes. Why not offer tax cuts to every person and company in Connecticut?John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan did it and it increased revenue to the coffers of state and federal treasuries.Liberal Democrats are genetically disposed to raising taxes for no matter what reason.Budget deficit? Raise taxes. More illegal immigrants on the dole? Raise taxes. Need more school lunch programs? Raise taxes.One would hope the Connecticut state legislature could finally admit that they don’t have a revenue problem, they have a spending problem.One of the most apt phrases I ever heard for any situation was from Lt.

"With Trump rollback, school lunch could get more white bread","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) — Is white bread about to make a comeback on school lunch menus? After complaints about taste and costs, the Trump administration rolled back a rule that required foods like pasta and bread be made with whole grains. The cafeteria directors who lobbied for the change say they just want greater flexibility to serve foods like white bread — which are more processed and have less fiber — when whole grains don’t work. In Vermont, the relaxed rule means white rice will be served with beans again. In Oregon, macaroni and cheese may return. And in South Dakota, students may notice a change with their soup. “The staff asked right away, ‘Oh my God, can we go back to the other saltines?’” said Gay Anderson, a school lunch director and president of the School Nutrition Association, which represents cafeteria operators and suppliers like Domino’s and Kellogg. The rollback addresses rules on grains, milk and salt championed by former first lady Michelle Obama. Since 2014, schools had been required to serve only whole grain versions of food as part of the national school lunch program, a critical source of free and reduced-price meals for millions of children. The idea is that whole grains would be more nourishing and help cultivate healthy habits amid alarming obesity rates . The Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is among the parties suing over the rollback, notes the standards were based on the government’s own dietary guidelines and that most schools were successfully meeting them.  But cafeteria operators said costs were higher, cooking was more difficult and students were throwing away more food. The School Nutrition Association said it’s more important that children who rely on the lunches eat something, and that the rule ignored cultural preferences, such as for flour tortillas in the Southwest or for white rice among Asian students. To ease the transition to whole grains, the U.S. Department of Agriculture let schools apply for temporary waivers to serve select dishes that didn’t meet the whole-grain rule. For the last school year, it said about 20 percent of districts asked permission to serve refined grains that are enriched to add back some nutrients. Among the frequently waived foods were pasta , pizza , tortillas and biscuits , which one Georgia lunch official joked affects the “tests scores of rednecks ,” according to records obtained by The Associated Press from state agencies. Other waived foods included beignets, cinnamon rolls, corn dogs, sugar cookies and Pop Tarts. One district requested a waiver for croissants because it said students don’t like the whole-grain version. “Plus they are 20 cents more per serving,” the district said. Then in December, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the USDA was going back to the old standard: At least half of grain foods must be rich in whole grains. The agency said that does away with the red tape of making schools get waivers, and gives schools more flexibility to offer wholesome meals that also reduce food waste. Whitney Ellersick, a school lunch director in Portland, Oregon, said the change means her district will no longer need a waiver for its lasagna. But she was surprised by the extent of the rollback. “I was a little shocked to see it go to 50 percent,” Ellersick said. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said the USDA’s rollback may be halting progress made by schools, which could be tempted to bring back more refined grains that cost less or are easier to make. Already, the group notes the USDA defines “whole grain rich” as being half whole grain, meaning there’s built-in wiggle room to make bread and pasta students won’t mind. Bettina Elias Siegel of The Lunch Tray website also noted a recent USDA report that found that “plate waste” was comparable before and after the rules were implemented in 2014, undermining arguments they were prompting students to throw away more food. The report also found that students took advantage of lunches more often in schools with healthier lunches. The American Heart Association likewise criticized the decision to relax the rules and called on school districts to stick to the previous standards, which also included stricter rules on salt and milk. Among the districts that plan to do so is Boston, where fifth grader Trinity Wilson likes the brown rice. She said it’s is healthier than white rice. “I know that because my mom told me,” Wilson said. But some school lunch officials say the rollback could help smaller districts that don’t have access to as many products. In Arkansas, students in the Magnet Cove district accepted whole-grain Pop Tarts and other changes, officials say, but still prefer the old noodles, biscuits and rolls. “They’re tastier, softer and fluffier,” said Danny Thomas, the district’s superintendent. In Burlington, Vermont, white rice and beans can return to menus. Doug Davis, the district’s food director and incoming president of the School Nutrition Association, said it’s a healthy dish that students will actually eat. To avoid buying two types of rice, Davis said white rice will likely also be used in stir fries and soups. He plans to stick mostly to whole grains, but he appreciates not having to. Whole-grain pasta isn’t ideal for mac and cheese, Davis noted. “Would we make a change on that? I don’t know,” he said.

Over half of students receive school lunches free or reduced price,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. LIHUE — More than half of Kauai’s students who eat school lunch receive free or reduced-priced meals. Kauai’s mark of 52.7 percent is near the state average, 46.5 percent, according to the state Department of Education. In some cases, this is the only hot meal a child eats each day. “I don’t want it to sound like a cliche, but for some students, these truly are the only hot meals that they get,” said Dexter Kishia, supervisor for HIDOE’s School Food Services Branch. “If they didn’t get a free meal this way, then they wouldn’t be able to afford a meal. It’s definitely necessary and it’s a good entitlement for families to have.” On Kauai and Niihau, nearly 50 percent of students eat school lunch. Reduced rate lunch is 40 cents, compared to the normal $2.50 for younger students and $2.75 for high schoolers. “Not all families take advantage of it, but usually the participation rate is pretty high. It can be up to 80 or 90 percent participation for kids until high school, where it drops to 20 to 50 percent with the meal program,” Kishia said. But free and reduced meals aren’t just for families and children living in poverty. Subsidized lunches are available to children from families that earn up to $51,708, for a family of four, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level are eligible for free meals. Meanwhile, families with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level are eligible for reduced-price meals, for which students can be charged no more than 40 cents.  One thing that the USDA has allowed HIDOE to implement is the Community Eligibility Provision, which puts free meals in the hands of students regardless of economic standing. “Kekaha Elementary is under that provision currently,” Kishia said. “The provision allows, as long as we get to 60 percent participation based off of direct certification percentage, that we serve all the student meals at that school for free.” The fact that Kekaha Elementary receives this provision makes DOE Kauai Complex Area Superintendent Bill Arakaki happy. “Breakfast and lunch are the two most important meals for students so that they can learn. If they’re fed well and not hungry, it really helps them focusing and learning,” Arakaki said. The provision began two years ago with seven schools and was increased to 30 throughout the state in 2016. “We definitely know that we can increase the (number of) Community Eligibility Provision schools to solve the problem for gap groups,” he said. The provision isn’t just about providing students free meals, it’s also helping to provide economic support to the parents. “Almost every year at the Legislature, there’s a bill that comes up regarding gap groups,” Kishia said. “Folks that make just enough, the middle class or lower middle class, they make too much to qualify for reduced benefits but really not enough to pay for their child’s lunch.” “If a parent had two kids in elementary school eating lunch, that’s $5 a day, then you multiply that by five days. It does add up,” he added. “It’s a school-by-school decision,” Kishia said. “The USDA doesn’t allow the state to incur a debt; the school would have to pay off any negative balances by the end of the year. We’ve had this issue come up on Kauai a few years ago.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.",https://apnews.com/article/education-lihue-78adb019c4944fceabc4782c29c9ee19

Trump administration rules that could deny green cards to immigrants if they use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance are going into effect. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Monday it is moving forward with one of its most aggressive steps yet to restrict legal immigration: Denying green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance. Federal law already requires those seeking to become permanent residents or gain legal status to prove they will not be a burden to the U.S. — a “public charge,” in government speak —but the new rules detail a broader range of programs that could disqualify them. It’s part of a dramatic overhaul of the nation’s immigration system that the administration has been working to put in place, despite legal pushback. While most attention has focused on President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, including recent raids in Mississippi and the continued separation of migrant parents from their children, the new rules target people who entered the United States legally and are seeking permanent status. Trump is trying to move the U.S. toward a system that focuses on immigrants’ skills instead of emphasizing the reunification of families. Under the new rules, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now weigh whether applicants have received public assistance along with other factors such as education, income and health to determine whether to grant legal status.  The rules will take effect in mid-October. They don’t apply to U.S. citizens, though immigrants related to the citizens may be subject to them. Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the rule change will ensure those who come to the country don’t become a burden, though they pay taxes. “We want to see people coming to this country who are self-sufficient,” Cuccinelli said. “That’s a core principle of the American dream. It’s deeply embedded in our history, and particularly our history related to legal immigration.” Migrants make up a small percentage of those who get public benefits. In fact, many are ineligible for such benefits because of their immigration status.  Immigrant rights groups strongly criticized the changes, warning the rules would scare immigrants away from asking for needed help. And they voiced concern the rules give officials too much authority to decide whether someone is likely to need public assistance in the future. The Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center said it would file a lawsuit, calling the new rules an attempt to redefine the legal immigration system “in order to disenfranchise communities of color and favor the wealthy.” And David Skorton, president and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges said, “The consequences of this action will be to potentially exacerbate illnesses and increase the costs of care when their condition becomes too severe to ignore,” “This change will worsen existing health inequities and disparities, cause further harm to many underserved and vulnerable populations and increase costs to the health care system overall, which will affect all patients,” he said in a statement. Cuccinelli defended the move, insisting the administration was not rejecting long-held American values. Pressed on the Emma Lazarus poem emblazoned below the Statue of Liberty that reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” he told reporters at the White House: “I’m certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statue of Liberty.” A new Pew Research Center survey released Monday found the American public is broadly critical of the administration’s handling of the wave of migrants at the southern border, with nearly two-thirds of Americans — 65% — saying the federal government is doing a very bad or somewhat bad job. The survey found broad support for developing a pathway to legal status for immigrants living in the country illegally. On average, 544,000 people apply for green cards every year, with about 382,000 falling into categories that would be subject to the new review, according to the government. Guidelines in use since 1999 refer to a “public charge” as someone primarily dependent on cash assistance, income maintenance or government support. Under the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security has redefined a public charge as someone who is “more likely than not” to receive public benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. If someone uses two benefits, that is counted as two months. And the definition has been broadened to include Medicaid, housing assistance and food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Following publication of the proposed rules last fall, the Homeland Security Department received 266,000 public comments, more than triple the average number. It made a series of amendments to the final rules as a result. For example, women who are pregnant and on Medicaid or who need public assistance will not be subject to the new rules during pregnancy or for 60 days after giving birth. The Medicare Part D low-income subsidy also won’t be considered a public benefit. And benefits received by children until the age of 21 won’t be considered. Nor will emergency medical assistance, school lunch programs, foster care or adoption, student loans and mortgages, food pantries, homeless shelters or disaster relief. Active U.S. military members are also exempt, as are refugees and asylum seekers. And the rules will not be applied retroactively, officials said. Green card hopefuls will be required to submit three years of federal tax returns in addition to a history of employment. If immigrants have private health insurance, that will weigh heavily in their favor. According to an Associated Press analysis of census data, low-income immigrants who are not citizens use Medicaid, food aid, cash assistance and Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, at a lower rate than comparable low-income native-born adults. Non-citizen immigrants represent 6.5% of those participating in Medicaid and 8.8% of those receiving food assistance. The new public assistance threshold, taken together with higher requirements for education, work skills and health, will make it more difficult for immigrants to qualify for green cards, advocates say. “Without a single change in the law by Congress, the Trump public charge rules mean many more U.S. citizens are being and will be denied the opportunity to live together in the U.S. with their spouses, children and parents,” said Ur Jaddou, a former Citizenship and Immigration Services chief counsel who is now director of the DHS Watch run by an immigrant advocacy group. “These are not just small changes. They are big changes with enormous consequences for U.S. citizens.” Colvin reported from Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.

SNAP flexibilities to promote self-sufficiency,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON — U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is promising increased cooperation with states in the operation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to promote self-sufficiency, integrity in the program, and better customer service. To make these improvements, USDA intends to offer state agencies greater local control over SNAP, the safety net program that serves millions of eligible, low-income individuals and families. Specifics on such flexibilities will be communicated to state agencies in the coming weeks. “SNAP was created to provide people with the help they need to feed themselves and their families, but it was not intended to be a permanent lifestyle,” said Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “As a former Governor, I know first-hand how important it is for states to be given flexibility to achieve the desired goal of self-sufficiency for people. We want to provide the nutrition people need, but we also want to help them transition from government programs, back to work, and into lives of independence.” The broad outlines of the coming flexibilities aimed at transitioning people into independence were described recently by Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services Acting Deputy Under Secretary and Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Administrator Brandon Lipps to state human services officials as part of a meeting of the Secretaries’ Innovation Group (SIG). SIG is a membership organization of state human service and workforce secretaries who share innovations and push for national solutions which favor healthy families, work, economic self-reliance, budget responsibility, and limited government.  The pledge to provide greater local control to help people achieve self-sufficiency echoed themes Lipps expressed in a letter to all state SNAP commissioners. Lipps’ letter listed the areas the new flexibilities will address: • Self-Sufficiency The American dream has never been to live on government benefits. People who can work, should work. Facilitating the transition for individuals and families to become independent, specifically by partnering with key stakeholders in the workforce development community and holding program recipients accountable for personal responsibility must be done. • Integrity Administrators must ensure the programs are run with the utmost integrity. Waste, fraud, or abuse from those who seek to undermine the mission or who do not take their responsibility seriously will not be tolerated. • Customer Service Together, it must be ensured that the programs serve SNAP participants well. In order to achieve a high degree of customer service, we at FNS must also provide states the flexibility to test new and better ways to administer the programs, recognizing that administrators are all accountable to the American taxpayer for the outcomes. “We believe states are laboratories of innovation and seek to learn from them what works and what does not,” Lipps wrote. “As necessary to address each of these focus areas, FNS will allow greater state flexibility in areas that do not increase costs to taxpayers or our various partners on the ground.” As FNS announces specific new flexibilities for promoting independence in the coming weeks, the agency will also continue to welcome additional ideas from the states that improve program integrity and best serve the participant and the American taxpayer. Guided by Secretary Perdue’s direction to “do right and feed everyone,” FNS will engage all relevant stakeholders throughout this process. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and the Summer Food Service Program. Together, these programs comprise America’s nutrition safety net. For more information, visit www.fns.usda.gov. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Chobani selected as Greek yogurt provider for school lunches,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Public schools across America will soon offer Greek yogurt as a meat substitute in school lunches beginning this fall. Chobani, a manufacturer of Greek yogurt, officials announced Monday it had been selected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to supply the yogurt as part of the federal school lunch program. The USDA decided in April to include Greek yogurt as a permanent option in its school lunch program after classifying it as an approved meat substitute in 2013. Chobani was selected as the exclusive provider after it successfully led a Greek yogurt pilot program over the past year, expanding the program from four to 12 states. During the first three months of the pilot program, schools in Idaho, New York, Arizona and Tennessee consumed 200,000 pounds of Chobani Greek yogurt. By the time the program was expanded, schools were ordering 700,000 pounds of yogurt. Company officials did not disclose the value of its USDA contract. Chobani, which is based in New York and opened a one of the biggest yogurt processing plant in the world in Idaho nearly three years ago, leads the U.S. in Greek yogurt production. Greek yogurt is a thicker style yogurt that has twice the protein of traditional yogurts and uses hormone-free milk. “Chobani is a nutrient-intense food and getting children the best nutrition early in life is very important to us,” said Robert Post, senior director of Chobani’s nutrition and regulatory affairs, in a prepared statement. “Since the very beginning, Chobani has sourced milk from cows not treated with artificial growth hormones.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

GOP-controlled House subcommittees reject Trump budget cuts,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — Two Republican-controlled House subcommittees Wednesday soundly rejected President Donald Trump’s proposals to slash the Agriculture Department, overseas food aid and water projects. The unanimous votes by the House appropriations panels show the depth of opposition to Trump’s budget plan to make widespread cuts at most domestic agencies. One subcommittee has rejected Trump’s proposal to eliminate the $1.6 billion Food for Peace program that ships U.S.-grown food to hungry nations. The other subcommittee has restored a $1.2 billion cut proposed by Trump to Army Corps of Engineers water and navigation projects. The spending bills are part of $1.2 trillion-plus in annual agency budgets passed by Congress. Trump proposed to cut the Agriculture Department measure by roughly one-fourth; the panel instead cut the bill by about 5 percent from current levels. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, praised Republicans for “basically ignoring most of the cuts in the president’s budget.” The House Appropriations panel is plowing ahead with the bills even though Republicans controlling Congress have yet to agree on a budget to guide the process. Republican defense hawks are wielding great influence, prevailing in a plan to increase defense spending to $621 billion — an increase of about $70 billion, or 13 percent, from current levels — and pad war accounts by $10 billion above Trump’s request. But Republicans don’t have the stomach for Trump’s planned $54 billion, 10 percent cut to domestic programs and foreign aid. Instead, they are proposing cuts of about 1 percent, on average, in nondefense programs.  Democrats, however, vow to oppose spending legislation that fails to increase domestic programs, and their votes are needed to pass the measures through the Senate. And without Democratic support, GOP efforts to boost the Pentagon budget would be reversed by rules left over from a 2011 budget and debt deal that would impose automatic cuts known as sequestration. In a provision related to the agriculture spending bill, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., won a provision that would direct the Agriculture Department, which runs the federal school lunch program, to curb the practice known as “lunch shaming,” in which some schools have embarrassed children whose parent have fallen behind in their lunch payments. “They’ve taken their plate of food and they’ve thrown it out. They put stickers on kids that say, ‘I owe school lunch.’ What are we talking about?” said DeLauro. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"3 Hawaii schools to begin serving more fresh, local food","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HILO, Hawaii (AP) — Three Hawaii schools are beginning to serve fresh local food as part of a new program that aims to gradually incorporate more fresh and locally produced food into school meals. Keaau High School, Kalanianaole Elementary School and Keaukaha Elementary School are piloting the new farm-to-table program. To implement the idea, food service staff at each school began requesting local items such as island-raised beef and produce from current vendors as much as possible. They next hope to forge ties with local growers and producers to buy from them directly. Keaau High School will host an invitation-only, farm-to-table taste and sample event Dec. 1 to illustrate the concept for local vendors, farmers, lawmakers and agriculture industry members. Eventually, Keaau hopes to serve up to 50 percent local items on each menu, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported . Every public school in Hawaii participates in the National School Lunch Program, a federal program that reimburses schools for lunches served each day so long as they adhere to established U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition guidelines. Some schools have said that meeting those federal guidelines — while preparing food students will still eat — can be challenging. Keaau and several other Hawaii public schools began offering students multiple menu entree choices this year in hopes of increasing participation.  Keaau’s pilot program is still “in its infancy,” Keaau Vice Principal Ron Jarvis said. Staff members are working to configure quantities needed and when certain items might be available contingent on the season, he said. Preparing fresh items also can be more costly and time consuming. For example, forming fresh-beef patties by hand takes longer than prepping frozen or canned items. Local food still must adhere to federal nutrition standards, and buying local also can be more expensive, said Lynn Hiratsuka, supervisor for the School Food Services Branch.

(Kyodo News via AP) TOKYO (AP) — Japanese whalers returned to port Monday with their first catch after resuming commercial whaling for the first time in 31 years, achieving the long-cherished goal of traditionalists that is seen as largely a lost cause amid slowing demand for the meat and changing views on conservation. A fleet of five boats left the northern Japanese port of Kushiro earlier Monday and brought back two minke whales. A crane lifted them and slowly placed them on the back of a truck to be taken to a portside factory for processing. Workers in blue plastic overalls poured sake from paper cups onto the first whale to express thanks and celebrate the first catch. It was the first commercial hunt since 1988, when Japan switched to what it called research whaling after commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission. Japan gave six months’ notice that it was withdrawing from the IWC, a move that took effect Sunday. The Fisheries Agency said the hunts will stay within the country’s exclusive economic zone, and the catch quota for the rest of this year will be 227 whales, fewer than the 637 that Japan hunted in the Antarctic and the northwestern Pacific in its research program in recent years. The announcement of the quota, originally planned for late June, was delayed until Monday in an apparent move to avoid criticism during this past weekend’s Group of 20 summit in Osaka. As the boats left port, whalers, their families and local officials in two major whaling towns, Shimonoseki in southwestern Japan and Kushiro in the north, celebrated the fresh start, hoping for their safe return and a good catch. Shimonoseki is Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s electoral constituency.  “We hope commercial whaling will be on track as soon as possible, contribute to local prosperity and carry on Japan’s rich whale culture to the next generation,” Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo. Officials said the catch of the two minke whales was a nice surprise because they were not thought to be in the area and whalers were expecting Monday’s trip to be only ceremonial. Fisheries Agency officials said the whale meat will be auctioned at a local fish market Thursday and later hit stores, mainly in the region but possibly in Tokyo. Whalers are hoping for a special price for the historic meat that is higher than the average 2,000 yen per kilogram ($18 per 2.2 pounds) that their counterparts from Antarctic research whaling used to get. While the resumption of commercial whaling was condemned by many conservation groups, others see it as a face-saving way to let the government’s embattled and expensive whaling program gradually succumb to changing times and tastes. Despite massive attention, tax money and political support from ruling party lawmakers, whaling in Japan involved only a few hundred people and accounted for less than 0.1% of the total meat consumption in fiscal 2017, according to government data. Whale meat was an affordable source of protein during the lean times after World War II, with annual consumption peaking at 223,000 tons in 1962. But whale was quickly replaced by other meats. The supply of whale meat fell to 6,000 tons in 1986, the year before the moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the IWC banned the hunting of several whale species. Under its research whaling, which was criticized as a cover for commercial hunts because the meat was sold on the market, Japan caught as many as 1,200 whales a year. It drastically cut back its catch in recent years after international protests escalated and whale meat consumption slumped at home. Today, about 4,000-5,000 tons are supplied in Japan annually, or 30-40 grams (1-1.4 ounces) of whale meat per person a year, Fisheries Agency officials say. The research whaling program lost money for years — 1.6 billion yen ($15 million) in the last year alone. Japan will stick to a very strict catch quota and will continue conducting research, Hideki Moronuki, a Fisheries Agency official and the chief negotiator at the IWC, said in a recent interview. He said Japan’s commercial whaling will never harm whale stocks. The commercial whaling will be carried out by two groups. The mother factory ship Nisshin-maru and two support boats that used to go to the Antarctic will travel as far as Japan’s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone to catch minke, Bryde’s and sei whales. Five other smaller ships will stay closer to the coast but also hunt minkes, in addition to 168 Baird’s beaked and two other kinds of small whales they used to catch outside of IWC jurisdiction. Altogether, they are to catch 52 minkes, 150 Bryde’s and 25 sei whales through Dec. 31. Whales caught in coastal waters will be brought back for fresh local consumption at any of six local whaling hubs that are mainly in northern Japan but include Taiji, the home constituency of ruling Liberal Democratic Party heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai. The town is also known for its dolphin hunts shown in the documentary movie “The Cove.” Whale meat caught further off the coast will be frozen and distributed for wider consumption. Moronuki says the fate of commercial whaling depends on whether whale meat is widely accepted by consumers since it won’t receive as many subsidies as before. The government, however, plans to provide as much as 5 billion yen ($46 million) for projects to help stabilize commercial whaling, including development of rich whale hunting grounds and research and development in the first few years, officials said. Moronuki said he hopes whale meat will be reasonably priced so it will gain long-term popularity instead of being an expensive delicacy for a limited clientele. The government used to sell whale meat caught in the scientific program for school lunch programs at discounted prices, he said. “The future of commercial whaling depends on how popular whale meat can be,” he said. “Whale meat is a traditional food in Japan and I would like many people to try and develop a taste for it, especially younger people.” A 2017 survey by the Japan Whaling Association showed about 64% of respondents said they have eaten whale meat, but most said they haven’t had any in five years. Ultimately, the resumption of traditional whaling may end up saving large government subsidies and the lives of many whales, experts say. “What we are seeing is the beginning of the end of Japanese whaling,” said Patrick Ramage, director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. “It is a win-win solution that results in a better situation for whales, a better situation for Japan, a better situation for international marine conservation efforts and is therefore to be welcomed.” Whaling is losing support in other whaling nations including Norway and Iceland, where whalers have cut back on catches in recent years amid criticism that commercial hunts are bad for their national image and tourism. Iceland caught only 17 whales, while Norway hunted 432 in the 2017-2018 season, way below their catch quota of 378 and 1,278 respectively, according to the IWC. Japanese are also beginning to see ecotourism as a better option for whales than hunting them for food. “People in coastal communities all do better when whales are seen and not hurt,” Ramage said.

Conaway discusses farm bill,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Congressman Mike Conaway said he expects to release a massive farm bill in the coming months that seeks to reauthorize and reform food assistance programs this year, but revealed little on Monday about any potential cuts. The farm bill is passed about every five years and usually relies on a coalition of Democrat and Republican support. It ties farm subsidies with federal food assistance such as after school lunch programs, Meals on Wheels and a program that channels surplus commodities to local food banks. As Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, the District 11 Republican Conaway plays a critical role in drafting and passing the farm bill. Conaway has held three years of hearings, including some in West Texas, and influenced the farm bill that is being scored today by the Congressional Budget Office for a cost estimate. “Right now all we’ve focused on is getting the policy correct: getting help to people when they need it,” Conaway said at the West Texas Food Bank on Monday. “For folks that need temporary help, making sure it’s there, making sure it’s temporary — it doesn’t become a way of life. …The elderly, children, the mentally and physically disabled: We are always going to be helping them.” The bulk of spending on the farm bill funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, (SNAP), a program formally known as food stamps that Conaway called “an integral part of feeding folks here in the United States.”  Conaway said that previous attempts to change SNAP were driven by targeted cuts instead of policy. Conaway said the new farm bill will include “strengthened work requirements and training” for SNAP in an economy that is improving. His public remarks followed a private roundtable that included officials at the West Texas Food Bank, representatives of Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, top advocates of H-E-B and Walmart, and local representatives including State Rep. Brooks Landgraf. Representatives of Feeding Texas, the statewide food bank network, and the San Antonio Food Bank also attended the roundtable. Attendees of the roundtable also discussed Hurricane Harvey disaster response. West Texas Food Bank Executive Director Libby Campbell said Conaway had been key in providing emergency aid after Hurricane Harvey such as disaster food stamps that eased the ongoing relief work borne by food banks. The last farm bill passed in 2014 was considered two years late and authorized spending of about $956 billion during a 10 year period, according to the CBO. Cornyn and Cruz were among about a dozen lawmakers from Texas that voted against it. But Conaway said he believed the new farm bill would draw bipartisan support. “I believe it will be bipartisan; I believe it will have to be bipartisan,” Conaway said. “And this whole work has been done in conjunction with my Democrat colleagues, and I’ve not done anything specifically to flush Democrats off the bill so that they won’t support it. I’m working hard to make sure hunger is not a partisan issue.” Several pieces of the farm bill are critically important to organizations like the West Texas Food Bank, along with the 19 counties it serves. This includes The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP. Under the program, the federal government purchases surplus agricultural commodities such as peanut butter or cheese and distributes them to states so they can be provided to emergency food providers like food banks. The West Texas Food Bank also relies on federal support, authorized in the farm bill, for its Kids Café program that provides meals to children in need. Campbell said “being able to have the ear of Chairman Conaway is so important” for the 19 counties the food bank serves ahead of the farm bill legislation. “I think he’s going to do his very best to protect those programs that he knows are important, and I think that he also realizes that if some of those programs get cut there will be strains that will be put onto food banks that have not been there before,” Campbell said. “And I think he’s well aware of what the effects will look like on his local food bank.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A price to pay for defense increase,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. San Antonio, home to the Defense Department’s largest installation — Joint Base San Antonio — and with some $9.8 billion in direct defense spending, has earned the moniker Military City, U.S.A. And Texas, the nation’s third-largest recipient among the states in total defense spending — at $37.9 billion — is no piker in this category, either. It stands to reason that both stand to gain from President Donald Trump’s proposal to boost military spending by nearly 10 percent, an increase of about $54 billion. But neither the city nor the state should view this proposal in such narrow terms. Domestic spending will certainly suffer, though the president says he will leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. Leaving the two unscathed is, in a sense, laudable, though both could benefit from some reform. The administration has also said that cuts in foreign aid will help pay for this defense boost. But foreign aid is about 1 percent of the budget, or $36.5 billion. That means remaining domestic spending will have to be gouged to pay for this. The State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are thought to be targeted for cuts — in itself counterproductive — but other agencies are also likely to suffer. It is simply a budgetary fact of life for Texas. Federal funding — matched by the state — ensures that needy Texans have access to vital safety net programs. Texas ranks eighth (just behind California) among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the widest income inequality. San Antonio is, sadly, also a national leader among the nation’s largest cities. About 18 percent of Texans live in poverty. In the 2014-15 biennium, federal funds accounted for 32.5 percent of Texas funds, according to a document prepared for the Legislature in January by the Legislative Budget Board. Of these federal funds, 63.5 percent were for programs in health and human services, 15.4 percent for education, and 16.4 percent for business and economic development. This, out of a total of $68 billion in federal funds.  There was $24.3 billion for Medicaid (now also a target in the GOP’s health care plan); nearly $1.5 billion for the National School Lunch Program and another $603.5 million for school breakfasts; $1.37 billion for Title I grants to schools; $526.8 million for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; and $513.7 million for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. The president proposes budgets; Congress approves them; and rarely do the two versions resemble one another. We urge the Texas congressional delegation to think this one, in particular, through.

EDITORIAL: Death of Kika de la Garza leaves a void in Valley,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. His simple nickname and demeanor belied the power he wielded in the halls of our nation’s capital. Eligio de la Garza, known everywhere as Kika, represented the entire Rio Grande Valley for much of his 30 years in Congress. In the Valley, the jovial man with the raspy voice talked mostly about the needs of the people he represented, and the future of their children. Most local residents knew him only in this light, as the personable man of the people. In Washington, however, Kika de la Garza was known, and respected, as a shrewd dealmaker who was able to cobble together major pieces of legislation that conservatives and liberals alike could support. De la Garza, who died Monday at age 89 at a Mission care center, served in the U.S. House of Representatives for more than three decades, from 1965 to 1997. And for nearly half of that tenure the Mission native was chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, holding the post during all or part of the Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations. The agriculture post is one of the most powerful positions in government. As chairman de la Garza oversaw the development of several U.S. Farm Bills, five-year plans that govern everything from agriculture subsidies to commodity distributions for needy families and even school lunch programs across the country. He also helped draft key elements of the North American Free Trade Agreement and other international trade deals. De la Garza was instrumental in the development of sugar cane growth and processing in South Texas. The non-native crop now covers a large part of the Valley and is a major part of the region’s economy. The federal Food and Agricultural Act still carries the “de la Garza amendment” that adds sugar cane and sugar beets to the list of commodities that qualify for federal loans and other support programs.  Despite his influence and hard work in Washington, de la Garza could never be called an absent legislator, unlike many lawmakers who plant deep roots in the capital, rarely return to their home districts and stay in Washington as lobbyists after they leave Congress. No, Kika frequently came back often to the Valley to interact with constituents both old and young. He enjoyed appearing at many of the festivals and parades across the Valley. In fact, he was known to appear perched on a convertible seat as a marshal or dignitary leading a parade, then show up again later near the end, walking the route and shaking hands with his constituents. De la Garza’s funeral Mass is scheduled for 2 p.m. Friday at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Mission, with burial at Valley Memorial Gardens. The public is invited to honor him with donations to the E. “Kika” de la Garza Endowed Scholarship Fund at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The fund is only one of many ways Kika de la Garza will continue to leave his mark on a Rio Grande Valley that is all the better because of his service. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Correction: Utah Alcohol Sales story,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — In a story Jan. 30 about rising liquor sales in Utah, The Associated Press reported erroneously the name of a wine company. It is Kendall-Jackson Vintner’s, not Kendall-Jackson Vinter’s. A corrected version of the story is below: Rising Utah liquor sales fueled by more non-Mormons, tourism In Mormon dominated Utah where alcohol is frowned upon, liquor sales keep climbing each year By BRADY McCOMBS Associated Press SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — In Mormon dominated Utah where alcohol is frowned upon, liquor sales keep climbing each year. State residents bought nearly $428 million in alcohol last year to set another record, continuing a two-decade trend likely fueled a steady influx of new out-of-state residents and a thriving tourism sector. Alcohol sales at Utah restaurants, bars and 45 state-controlled liquor stores rose 5 percent last fiscal year, shows an annual report released this month from Utah’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Sales have increased each year going back to 1996, the first year state data is available. Sales have increased 40 percent just in the last six years. Demographers say a strong economy has drawn many non-Mormons to the state over the last 25 years for jobs. Combine that with flourishing tourism driven by the state’s ski areas and red-rock national parks and you have more people in Utah who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which instructs members to avoid drinking alcohol.  “It is part of the changing demographics of the state,” said Terry Wood, spokesman for Utah’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. “This demographic is more likely to purchase alcohol.” Those who drink in Utah appear to be consuming more — the 2.94 average gallons of alcohol consumed per capita was up 3 percent from the year before. It was the 11th consecutive year that the measure increased, agency figures show. The state was among the lowest in the US in that measure as of 20ch15, the most up-to-date comparable data available, according to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Wood noted that the state doesn’t advertise its liquor stores, saying, “We are not encouraging alcohol use or sales, not discouraging it. It’s just there. We provide that service.” Nearly $179 million from the sales went to the state coffers, state agencies and other alcohol abuse prevention programs. That included $43 million to the state school lunch program; $4 million to state bureau of investigation for liquor enforcement; and $2 million to an underage drinking prevention program. About $23 million in sales taxes went to state, county and city governments. The state’s net profit that goes to the state general fund — —$106 million — marked only a 2-percent increase from the year before, the lowest in seven years. That can be attributed to an across-the-board increase in operating costs that included a 4-percent raise for liquor store employees, Wood said. The sales figures don’t include beer that contains less than 4 percent alcohol by volume, which can be purchased at grocery and convenience stores. They cover the state’s fiscal year from July 2016 through June 2017. Once again, wine was the state’s favorite kind of alcohol with about 3.6 million gallons sold. A category called “spirits” that includes vodka, whiskey and tequila was second with 3.15 million gallons sold, while of high-alcohol beer was third with about 2 million gallons sold. Malt beverage was the only category in which sales decreased. The 213,000 gallons sold were down from about 250,000 gallons each of the previous two years. Among wines, Cooks Brut Sparkling Wine was the top seller followed by Vendange Pinot Grigio and Kendall-Jackson Vintner’s Reserve Chardonnay. The top-selling spirit was Barton Vodka, followed by Taaka Vodka and Fireball Cinnamon Whisky. Icehouse led in beer sales by a wide margin, followed by a Squatters Hop Rising Double IPA and Busch Ice Lager. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Grin and rate it: Research uses emojis for school lunches,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — The smiling, blissful and confused-looking emojis dotting the electronic landscape may hold the key to ferreting out grade-school children’s true feelings about foods, Kansas researchers say, and could help schools across the nation cut down on lunchroom food waste. Most school lunch programs in the U.S. already do taste tests, but their efforts pale in comparison to the scope of the research project at the Sensory and Consumer Research Center at Kansas State University Olathe, which is developing a scientific methodology to measure children’s face-emoji responses to food. So far, kids in Kansas and Ghana have been the guinea pigs. The goal is to create an “emoji ballot” that’s “applicable internationally across cultures, across countries,” said Marianne Swaney-Stueve, who manages the center. “And there really is no language barrier.” The researchers also hope it will help schools pick foods that children will eat and help manufacturers make products that schools will want to buy. Food waste has been more of an issue in the United States since new federal nutrition regulations were implemented in 2012 that mandated healthier products in school lunches. For example, more than 26 percent of the food budget at Boston’s middle schools was discarded by students, according to a study cited by the nonprofit School Nutrition Association. If translated nationwide, that would be more than $1.23 billion of school food wasted each year. Already, about three-quarters of U.S. school districts are doing taste tests with students and nearly all have implemented initiatives such as nutrition education or locally grown foods in an effort to make meals more appetizing, according to an association survey of 1,100 schools conducted last year.  “School nutrition professionals are always looking for new ideas to promote healthier choices to students ... to find ways to get more student feedback so they can develop kid-approved menus that are healthy and also appealing to students,” association spokeswoman Diane Pratt-Heavner said. Despite those efforts, government data shows more than 1 million fewer students are choosing school lunches. The emoji methodology research, which began in 2014, first started with focus groups of children ages 7 to 11 in Olathe. Children in the focus group tasted and rated three foods: plain oatmeal, pepperoni pizza Lunchables and Japanese Ramune soda. The premise was to have food that was boring, familiar and an “out-of-the-box” item that participants had not likely encountered — the sweet, strawberry-flavored soda is packaged in a bottle with a marble that releases carbon dioxide — to provide a baseline comparison for testing responses to other foods. The Lunchables were well-liked, but the soda was “polarizing” because some thought it tasted like medicine, doctoral student Katy Gallo said. The children also rated the oatmeal disappointing because it lacked flavor, though some were hungry and ate all of it anyway. Researchers used those results to determine which emojis and words the children used and which ones were confusing, then questioned them about their favorite foods and how those made them feel. They narrowed down students’ choices to 28 face emojis and 28 words. In a later taste test, researchers had the children emoji-rate other foods. They had particularly positive emoji responses, pointing to the grinning face, smiling face with smiling eyes or a smile with the tongue out, to the chocolate graham snacks, orange juice, white bread and white grapes. The least-liked food tested, earning a worried face, confused face or confounded face: fresh spinach. Brenan Kuzmic, an 11-year-old, said the emojis made it easier for him to communicate. Chocolate graham snacks won a smiley face from him, while the fresh spinach earned just a “normal face,” he said. Similar polling was done with 12-year-old students at 10 schools in Accra, Ghana, to see if cultural differences existed in emoji use. “They are at an age where they have opinions, and sometimes they don’t feel like they are being heard,” Gallo said of all the students. “And so they really appreciate being able to give that kind of feedback.” Researchers will return to Ghana for the next phase of testing this month, followed by similar taste tests in Olathe in May. They also plan to further narrow the number of emojis kids can choose. The school lunch program at Ashburn, Virginia-based Loudoun County Public Schools, north of Washington, D.C., has used three emojis — one with a big smile, another with a straight line for a mouth and one with a frown — at taste parties for years, said Becky Domokos-Bays, supervisor of school nutrition services. Domokos-Bays, who’s also president-elect for the School Nutrition Association, was intrigued by the Kansas research, saying she would “absolutely” be interested in using that emoji methodology with her students. “Our opinion doesn’t count so much as theirs does,” Domokos-Bays said. “Because they are the ones who are eating.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Central Lee now has its own food service director,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. DONNELLSON – Central Lee Community School District has a new food service director after 10 years. Amy Fogarty of Donnellson started working as the district’s new food service director this month. The district had a total of 18 candidates. The last full time food service director for Central Lee was in 2007. Since then, the district shared a food service director, Melanie Quereto, with Fort Madison Community School District. Quereto retired this semester and now Lisa Kibby is the new school director. Superintendent Andy Crozier said now there will be a person there full-time, every day. Fogarty has food preparation experience and customer service experience from working at Harvestville Farms, and she was also a retail manager for RJ Reynold’s. She is also co-president of the Parent-Teacher Organization. “Its a great school district...I thought it was a nice fit for working here,” Fogarty said. As the food service director Fogarty will be responsible for evaluating, supervising, coordinating and directing the work duties of all food service employees; giving input to school board members; and monitoring the preparation and distribution of meals in the district. Although, its an adjustment for Fogarty to manage food in a different environment. Crozier said that she is enjoying it so far. “Amy is doing great so far,” Crozier said. “She is focused on learning about our operations and evaluating the program as a whole. She is using this information to consider changes for improvement for next year.”  Like most food service directors Fogarty will be responsible for preparing monthly menus, purchasing food commodities, assigning substitutes, keeping records, filing reports and overseeing the cleanliness and proper storage of all equipment. School Lunch Program Fogarty said she hopes to survey students as to their lunch preferences. She would like to create a gardening program for students to learn how to grow vegetables and use the food grown to help students learn about agriculture and eat healthy food. Unpaid Lunch Accounts Fogarty believes that the current lunch account policy will help with some of the unpaid lunch account. According to districts report the unpaid lunch account number has dropped to one account with a balance over $100. “We definitely do not have that much of a severe amount of unpaid lunch accounts,” Fogarty said. She said it could be every week that she will contact parents and guardians about their accounts, depending on the account’s severity. Overall Goal Fogarty said her goal this year is to watch and observe and see how they can improve on the menus to keep moving food on what they can improve on for the overall program. “My goal is to run an efficient, healthy, safe and successful kitchen,” Fogarty said. “And hopefully in the process kids will be happy with their meals and get a nutritious meal, So that they can get back to learning.” Originally from Kahoka Fogarty was born and raised in Kahoka, Mo., and she is a 1998 graduated from Clark County R-1 High School. She received her bachelor of science degree in liberal arts from the University of Iowa in 2004. Fogarty and her family moved to Donnellson about six years ago – largely, she says, because of the school district. “We thought that it was a great school district and they’re pretty consistent,” Fogarty said. “I thought that our kids could strive here. They seem concerned about every child and their learning.” Fogarty and her high school sweetheart Scott, a Farmington native and the district manager for Aldi’s, have been married for 13 years. They have twin sons, Austin and Evan, who are in second grade at Central Lee Elementary and both have participated in soccer, baseball, football, and basketball. The entire family is comprised of sport fans – particularly for the St. Louis Cardinals and Iowa Hawkeyes. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Pulses to pintos: A state of the bean market,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. GERING — Jon Sperl, merchandiser for New Alliance, gave producers his outlook on the year ahead for peas and beans Thursday, at WESTCO’s annual producers meeting at the Gering Civic Center. Sperl said the fragility of the marketplace is tied to production, politics and purchase choices. In a lesson learned from 2018, Sperl said producers rushed to produce more garbanzo beans — a staple for vegans and hummus-loving millenials. Farmers swung more acres of production to garbanzos because the market looked exciting. But that rush quickly created a situation where producers “became their own worst enemy,” Sperl said. Producers put 300,000 fewer acres into production for pulses — peas and lentils primarily — and overproduced acres of garbanzo beans, with hopes of capitalizing on a growing trend. “Unfortunately, the market (for garbanzos) went from $45, to this week, where they are trading at $0.14,” he said. “There are some tariffs in there, but you can see how quickly producers can oversupply the market in what I would call a specialty or niche market.” The pulse for cheap protein “People around the world don’t have the financial means we do, so cheap protein is a big deal,” Sperl said. For example, India — the world’ largest consumer of pulses — also grows 52 percent of the pulses produced in the world. Additionally, the subcontinent takes in about 50 percent of U.S. pulse exports, and about 80 percent of Canadian exports. However, India and China — the second largest global consumer of pulses — have been largely out of reach to U.S. growers for much of 2018 due to tariffs, Sperl said.  Sperl said the good news is that New Alliance coordinated the last few deliveries of beans to the Bridgeport facility after harvest in order to start splitting peas as quickly as possible. With the pea splitters running, more of those split peas have been put toward PL 480, an international food aid program established through the Agricultural Trade Development Assistance Act. This aid is typically destined for Africa, and 58 kilogram bags are shipped to meet those needs. Some of the production is also going to Section 32 — which purchases high-quality food each year to support the following USDA nutrition programs like the National School Lunch Program. And the pet food industry has also taken an increased interest in pulse proteins. “The perception is that pulses are healthier, so the pet food industry has become a big player in the pulse market,” he said. 2018: The year of the tariffs Tariffs globally have cost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of inefficiencies in the marketplace, Sperl said, with farmers bearing the brunt of that loss in value. Sperl said he came on staff at New Alliance in Nov. 1, 2017, and by Nov. 21, India put tariffs in place overnight — 50 percent on peas, 66 percent on garbanzos and 33 percent on lentils. On top of this, exports of U.S. origin faced an additional 10 percent in retaliatory tariffs resulting from President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum. Initially, the Indian tariffs were political in nature, Sperl said. Indian farmers experienced record production with four crops over two years, creating considerable excess that drove domestic prices down. The tariffs were supposed to be a temporary means to protect Indian farmers, coinciding with the election cycle that year. However, the tariffs have since been extended four times, with each extension lasting three months. “The good news is that (India) is a little drier this year and their acres are down,” Sperl said, adding that Canadian exporters believe the Indian market will reopen to pulse imports on March 31, when the last round of the tariff extension sunsets. And because India cannot grow enough to meet their own needs without North American production, they will need to reopen the markets. “It’s not a matter of if they will be back, but a matter of when,” Sperl said. “Mom is always right” In recent years, producers switched to slow-darkening pinto beans because they look better in the bag at the supermarket. However, when refried, slow-darkening pintos tend to have the color consistency of mashed potatoes or sour cream. “The consumer wanted them, but when mom refries the beans for the kids and they don’t look right, and all of the sudden she’s kicking that product back up the chain,” Sperl said. “We need to be aware of that because moms are always right.” If the ultimate consumer doesn’t like the product, producers need to respond, Sperl said. This is true for non-GMO and organic products popular in supermarkets, especially in urban areas. “You spend time in Denver or San Diego, it’s what the consumer wants,” he said. “It is what the consumer wants, and they’re willing to pay what they consider a premium.” Pintos North Dakota are the kingpins of the pinto market, leaving Nebraska at the tail of production. Sperl said North Dakota growers fire sale their pinto beans, with the average price being more than $22 in 2018. With the cost of processing splits and cleanouts at 10 percent, or more than $2, North Dakota producers are selling processed pinto beans out the door for $25. “There is no market in that,” Sperl said. “But if there’s any good news, they jumped in to the slow-darkening market and they don’t grow as good of beans as we do here in Nebraska.” Sperl said he hopes more North Dakota growers will get out of beans to help improve the prices. Market gateways for pintos are Florida (with access to the Caribbean), California and Texas. With ease of rail traffic south from Nebraska, Sperl said he has seen success in picking up accounts in Texas. In late October, Hurricane Willa made landfall on the west coast of Mexico, which damaged the bean crop in Mexico’s Sinaloa state, along with severe frosts in December that could prove to be a win for Box Butte and Scotts Bluff counties. While Mexico has had similar luck as the U.S. with record bean harvests, the downturn in this year’s harvest could lead to more demand for U.S. pintos. Great Northerns European buyers like a white bean, and since 80 percent of the world’s Great Northerns are grown here in the Panhandle, it has proved a popular, lucrative crop. However, with the European tariffs on U.S. imports, Sperl is nervous that Canadian growers may switch to growing Great Northerns. U.S. consumption continues to increase, but for foreign food aid programs, Sperl said that Section 32, PL 480 and world food programs are way behind in meeting their needs volume-wise. Thankfully, 207,000 bags of Great Northerns were recently sold and shipped as part of the World Food Aid relief to Yemen, a Middle Eastern country whose people are starving as a result of civil war. And because of that, the prices for Great Northerns have gone up from $2 to $3. “When you consider that the market of Great Northerns is a little over 1 million bags, and 207,000 were in one sale, it’s pretty exciting for the future,” Sperl said. And as the European markets work off their current stores, Sperl said he hopes the tariff situation will be rectified so Great Northerns can again meet pent-up European demand. Other markets that New Alliance has found since the trade spat began include Colombia, Chile and Costa Rica. “It’s interesting to see that we are competing with the alubia, a white bean from South America, and Argentina produces a lot of them,” Sperl said. “We’ve been able to ship all the way to Chile and compete with that bean. They love what you guys are producing.” What if? Corn is king and soybeans are queen. Even if the tariffs go away overnight, it will take a while for international markets to pick up again, finding ways to ship those beans and peas will be a concern. “One of the things I hope you hear from this is the urgency of making these market decisions,” Sperl said.

Passage of ‘lunch shaming’ bill leaves school funding issues,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The embarrassment of having a credit card declined for insufficient funds is hard enough for adults. For a child, standing in a school cafeteria line, a similar experience — through no fault of their own — can be traumatic. A bill that passed the Iowa Legislature this week targets so-called “lunch shaming,” where students whose families owe money are singled out, given inferior meals or even have their food dumped in the garbage. “The personal stories from all across Iowa from parents and children on food shaming could not only break your heart but are in stark contrast with the fundamental Iowa way that we treat our children,” Rep. Kirsten Running-Marquardt, a Cedar Rapids Democrat, said during floor debate on the bipartisan bill, which awaits final approval from Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. The challenge faced by schools is how to pay for meal services when families can’t or won’t replenish school meal accounts. Some still provide meals, while others turn to cheaper substitutes or allow a child to go without food altogether. Many students living in poverty qualify for federal subsidies that cover the full cost of their meals, but not all eligible families complete the necessary paperwork. Some districts have turned to private donations. Earlier this year, for example, the Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in Ames ran a fundraising promotion to help the Ames Community School District, donating about $7,750 over three weeks to pay for student meal debt, which exceeded $52,000. Crystal FitzSimons, the director of school and out-of-school time programs for the Washington-based nonprofit Food Research and Action Center, has examined Iowa’s bill and thinks it will be effective.  FitzSimons said the bill would make sure food served to children isn’t thrown away, that children whose families owe money aren’t punished and that schools don’t make public which families owe unpaid meal fees. “We know that kids who are hungry can’t learn, have a hard time focusing and concentrating, and there is a whole range of academic impacts that come from kids being hungry,” FitzSimons said. Iowa is following the lead of several states that have passed anti-shaming legislation. New Mexico was the first, approving such a law about a year ago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture required schools to adopt policies on unpaid meal debt by last summer. New York, California and other states since have launched anti-shaming efforts, including a bill signed into law in Virginia last month. Lawmakers in Louisiana and Maine are currently considering bills similar to Iowa’s legislation. Some states, such as Oregon, require schools to provide the regular meal to children regardless of how much debt they’ve accumulated. Iowa’s legislation encourages serving regular meals but doesn’t require it. Nationally, three-quarters of school districts have some level of unpaid meal debt, according to the School Nutrition Association. The total amount of school meal debt in Iowa isn’t known. The Iowa Department of Education doesn’t collect data, although spokeswoman Staci Hupp said an informal, anonymous survey that included about one-third of Iowa organizations that participate in the school lunch program found just over $300,000 in negative balances. “It all really depends on how each individual school district has decided how to handle those balances,” said Scott Litchfield, the legislative chairman of the School Nutrition Association Iowa. Litchfield said individual school district negative balances can range from $500 to in excess of $50,000. The average meal costs around $2.75 — “a lot less than any restaurant that I’ve ever been to,” Litchfield said. Schools would be allowed to make claims against delinquent families’ tax refunds and lottery winnings, although a nonpartisan analysis of the bill concluded districts won’t have the necessary information to file claims. A federal program known as community eligibility offers another path for high-poverty schools. The program allows for certain qualifying schools to offer free meals to all students. FitzSimons said the program is a “game-changer for schools.” More than 100 schools in Iowa already participate in the program, including two-thirds of those in the Des Moines Public Schools. Amanda Miller, the district’s director of food and nutrition, said Des Moines is still evaluating how it will respond to the new legislation if it’s enacted. But she said that community eligibility has made a positive impact for the district, and it avoids accumulating unpaid debts. “It levels the playing field,” Miller said. Private giving is another possible way to address meal debt. School districts will be allowed to set up special funds to collect donations under the new legislation, which requires the money to be used only for that purpose. Memory Bleth, a Council Bluffs woman who gave $3,000 to a local elementary school in 2016, said she doesn’t understand how schools could pay large salaries to administrators when some children can’t afford lunch. “I didn’t realize that was a thing that people even had to worry about,” Bleth said. “To me, that is just a burden that people shouldn’t have on their shoulders.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Lawmakers seal deal on $1.1T spending bill,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional aides say a final agreement has been sealed on a massive $1.1 trillion government-wide spending bill that would prevent a government shutdown and fund most of the government through next September. The hard-fought agreement would delay a politically-charged struggle over President Barack Obama’s new immigration policy until the new year but allow Republicans to take full control of Congress next month with a clean slate. The huge bill, to be officially released late Tuesday, also contains numerous policy provisions on financial regulations, the federal school lunch program and the maximum permissible workweek for long-haul truckers.

Worcester looks to expand breakfast in schools program,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) — The first things students in Robin Hoel’s second-grade class at Chandler Magnet School had out on their desks to start their school day Friday morning were not papers and pencils, but milk and cereal. All around the school, in fact, students were enjoying breakfast in their classrooms. The same scene plays out in the morning at 21 other schools in the city as well. Yet statewide, only around 100 schools partake in so-called “breakfast after the bell,” according to Kali Coughlan, a child nutrition coordinator at the Worcester County Food Bank, which is part of a coalition of food banks called Rise and Shine that is trying to get the concept to catch on at more schools. On Friday, Ms. Coughlan joined local school officials, lawmakers and other advocates on a tour of Chandler Magnet’s in-school breakfast program, which started this school year. “We really see a big difference when students get access to breakfast” in their classrooms, she said, as opposed to in the cafeteria before the school day begins. Part of the problem with the latter approach is that it’s not always possible to ensure students who need breakfast at school will always be able to get it in the small window after morning drop-off, she added. But there’s also a social/emotional factor. “It can be stigmatizing” for students to have to seek out breakfast while their classmates go to their homerooms instead, Ms. Coughlan said. “There’s something to be said for breaking bread together (in class). Teachers say it’s like a family sitting down and having breakfast.”  A new federal school nutrition program called the Community Eligibility Provision also makes it easier for districts to afford such an arrangement. Schools where at least 40 percent of the enrollment are “identified students” - the definition the government uses for needy students - are eligible to use the program, which through the U.S. Department of Agriculture fully reimburses districts for the cost of providing free breakfast and lunch to all their students, not just the low-income ones. In Central Massachusetts, districts including Worcester, Fitchburg, Webster, Athol-Royalston, Quaboag, Southbridge, and Ralph C. Mahar are already participating in the CEP, according to the state education department’s records. Ms. Coughlan said even non-CEP districts can offer in-school breakfast, although in those cases the schools would have to be responsible for the costs of feeding students who don’t qualify to receive free or reduced meal prices. A bill introduced earlier this year by state Sen. Sal DiDomenico and state Rep. Aaron Vega, meanwhile, would make it a requirement for schools where 60 percent or more of the students are free or reduced lunch-eligible to offer breakfast after the morning bell. Even in cases where the funding isn’t an issue, the decision to move breakfast into the classroom “comes down to logistics,” Ms. Coughlan said. In Worcester, for instance, where district officials intend to expand in-school breakfast to all schools in the system, it will take the addition of around 75 new cafeteria works to execute the plan, according to the city’s school nutrition director, Donna Lombardi. The district also had to renegotiate existing union workers’ contracts. “The funding’s there” to pay for all of that investment thanks to the USDA reimbursement, she said. “The schools just have to adapt.” Without the CEP, meanwhile, “it would be extremely difficult” to carry out the plan, according to Ms. Lombardi. But there is a payoff for schools, at least based on the results so far at Chandler Magnet. “What we were finding (before) was that kids were not eating (breakfast) in the cafeteria, because they wanted to go to the auditorium with their friends,” where students typically begin their morning, said the school’s principal, Ivonne Perez. While staff at the school had some initial reservations - there were worries “it was going to be a mess” in the classrooms, Ms. Perez said — the in-class breakfast has largely been successful, according to school officials. “We’ve been surprised by how great it’s worked,” Ms. Perez said. Proponents say the program is especially important at schools like Chandler Magnet, where nearly two-thirds of the students are deemed by the state to be “economically disadvantaged.” In many cases, school breakfast is the only breakfast available to those children on a daily basis. Among the impressed observers of Chandler Magnet’s program Friday morning were state representatives James O’Day, a Democrat from West Boylston, and Daniel Donahue, a Democrat from Worcester, who both said they’d support their colleagues’ bill mandating in-school breakfast at schools with large low-income populations. “Walking around the classrooms today, you could see how important it is,” Mr. Donahue said. “It would be a huge benefit for a lot of school districts.” “From what I’ve seen here ... it makes sense,” Mr. O’Day said. “It seems they have it pretty well-organized.” Online: https://bit.ly/2pI4Fu4 Information from: Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), http://www.telegram.com Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Republican front-runner enters Florida governor’s race,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BARTOW, Fla. (AP) — When Adam Putnam walks into the Curly Tails Barbecue in Bartow, he knows half the people inside and orders his favorite dish, a Barn Salad — which amounts to a mound of shredded meat on top of some vegetables. This is his hometown, and where he feels most comfortable. It’s where he brought a reporter from The Associated Press on Tuesday to discuss what he’s been long-rumored to desire: a run for governor. “I’m thrilled that people save for a whole year to visit our state, and they save for a lifetime to retire to our state,” said the 42-year-old, who currently holds the elected office of agriculture commissioner. “But I think Florida can be more than that. I think Florida can be the launchpad for the American Dream.” Putnam says he wants to encourage young people to come to Florida for high-tech agribusiness and science jobs. Setting aside money for research for citrus greening — the disease that’s devastating the orange and grapefruit groves — is one example of how to draw smart, young professionals here, he said. Putnam will hold a kickoff party not far from Curly Tails on Wednesday, in front of the historic courthouse built in 1908. The streets will be shut down for the event and Putnam spent Tuesday inviting everyone he talked with. “Come on out,” he said to a retired judge at Curly Tails. “We’ll feed you.” It’s a far cry from the news release and video that Florida’s current governor, Rick Scott, announced his candidacy with a press release and a video.  Putnam is the first Republican to declare his candidacy for the election that’s 18 months away — although Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran is considering a run and said he will decide whether to run for the Republican nomination after the 2018 Legislative session ends. Former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and Winter Park businessman Chris King have all announced to run for the Democratic nomination. Putnam, a married father of four, has always eyed the Governor’s mansion, and his political career — which spans his entire adult life — is something that his critics point to as a potential downside. At 21, he ran for the Florida Legislature. From 2001 to 2011, he was a congressman. He’s been agriculture commissioner since 2011, overseeing everything from credit-card skimmers to wildfires to a deadly insect that’s crippled Florida’s citrus industry. But Putnam is relying on his down-home style and his fifth-generation roots to boost his credibility among regular voters. He mentions eating at Ruby Tuesday’s, listening to both old country and western and Taylor Swift (because of his daughters), and loves to talk about his days working on his family’s citrus farms and cattle ranches. In terms of his positions on issues, he’s squarely conservative: pro-death penalty, anti-abortion and pro-gun. He’s been especially passionate about school lunch programs. During his time as agriculture commissioner, he’s encouraged school districts to align their menus to local harvests. He begins his campaign with about $7 million in the bank; his political action committee, Florida Grown, received $250,000 from Big Sugar — one of the state’s most lucrative crops — alone. He does acknowledge that campaigning may be different in the age of President Donald Trump. Putnam said that in his first 100 days, Trump made a “fantastic” selection for the Supreme Court with his nomination of Neil Gorsuch. And he added that what the president has done “to roll back some of the craziest rules to come out of EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) and the Corps of Engineers and other places that would have had a profound impact on Florida’s economy ... have all been positive things.” The governor’s race, however, is about Florida, not national politics, he said. “People want leadership that’s conservative,” he says. “They’re tired of people misleading them about the scope of the problem or the difficulty of the solutions. It is who I am and where I am from that represents the frustration with Tallahassee and with Washington. People believe the disconnect occurs because there’s a lack of honesty and authenticity.” Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush This story has been clarified to reflect that Putnam has $7 million, not $10.5 million in his coffers, after expenses.

(AP) — Teaching assistant Kelvin Holt watched as a preschool student fell to the back of a cafeteria line during breakfast in Killeen, Texas, as if trying to hide. “The cash register woman says to this 4-year-old girl, verbatim, ‘You have no money,’” said Holt, describing the incident last year. A milk carton was taken away, and the girl’s food was dumped in the trash. “She did not protest, other than to walk away in tears.” Holt has joined a chorus of outrage against lunchroom practices that can humiliate children as public school districts across the United States rethink how they cope with unpaid student lunch debts. The U.S. Agriculture Department is requiring districts to adopt policies this month for addressing meal debts and to inform parents at the start of the academic year. The agency is not specifically barring most of the embarrassing tactics, such as serving cheap sandwiches in place of hot meals or sending students home with conspicuous debt reminders, such as hand stamps. But it is encouraging schools to work more closely with parents to address delinquent accounts and ensure children don’t go hungry. “Rather than a hand stamp on a kid to say, ‘I need lunch money,’ send an email or a text message to the parent,” said Tina Namian, who oversees the federal agency’s school meals policy branch. Meanwhile, some states are taking matters into their own hands, with New Mexico this year becoming the first to outlaw school meal shaming and several others weighing similar laws.  Free and reduced-price meals funded by the Agriculture Department’s National School Lunch Program shield the nation’s poorest children from so-called lunch shaming. Kids can eat for free if a family of four earns less than about $32,000 a year or at a discount if earnings are under $45,000. It’s households with slightly higher incomes that are more likely to struggle, experts on poverty and nutrition say. Children often bear the brunt of unpaid meal accounts. A 2014 federal report found 39 percent of districts nationwide hand out cheap alternative meals with no nutritional requirements and up to 6 percent refuse to serve students with no money. The debate over debts and child nutrition has spilled into state legislatures and reached Capitol Hill, as child advocacy groups question whether schools should be allowed to single out, in any way, a child whose family has not paid for meals. “There’s no limit to the bad behavior a school can have. They just have to put it in writing,” said Jennifer Ramo, executive director of New Mexico Appleseed, an advocacy group on poverty issues. “We live in a credit society. I think schools should handle debt like everybody else does: You don’t take away food from children. You feed them and you settle the bill later.” Spurred by Appleseed and others, New Mexico in April passed its anti-meal-shaming law, which directs schools to work directly with parents to address payments and requires that children get a healthy, balanced meal regardless of whether debts are paid on time. Elsewhere, the California Senate in May unanimously approved a bill that prevents schools from denying lunch if a parent or guardian has not paid. Thresa Thomas, a Los Angeles Unified School District food service worker for students with severe physical and learning disabilities, grinds up complimentary cheese sandwiches in a food processor to serve through feeding tubes to students who don’t bring lunch and whose parents have not paid. “They’re not able to complain too much,” she said. “We should give them all the same food, and we should collect the money as much as possible.” Texas recently adopted a temporary grace period for students to keep eating cafeteria food while debt payments are negotiated with parents. At the federal level, language has been proposed for next year’s House appropriations bill that would set minimum standards to protect children from public embarrassment and leave them out of payment discussions. New Mexico’s Hunger-Free Students’ Bill of Rights Act was ushered through the Statehouse by Democratic Sen. Michael Padilla, who was raised in foster homes and vividly recalls having to sweep and mop the lunchroom to earn meals at an Albuquerque public school. “It’s shouldn’t be that way,” Padilla said. “This should not have to be a thought for a child.” Federal cash subsidies feed two out of three students statewide — yet meals still go unpaid, school administrators say. “The piece that is really different in this legislation is that you cannot turn a child away no matter what they owe,” said Nancy Cathey, who oversees food services at Las Cruces Public Schools. That provision is likely to drive up the district’s unpaid meal accounts, which recently totaled $8,000, she said. The district previously declined to serve high school students who cannot pay and extended a $25 credit to middle-schoolers. Most districts aim to keep meal costs close to $3.20, the typical federal reimbursement rate for free lunches. The Albuquerque district is still weighing whether it can afford to serve the same hot meal to all students and do away with an alternative cold meal that has been nicknamed derisively the “cheese sandwich of shame.” Sian McCullough of Albuquerque said her stepdaughter was confronted in first grade with an alternative brown-bag lunch when their meal account went unpaid. “The intent was, ‘We do this because the kids will go home embarrassed and send the money,’” she said. “It just didn’t sit well with me.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Key lawmakers weighed legislation to permit a reduction of benefits for up to 1 million retirees at economically distressed multiemployer pension plans, officials said late Monday as Congress labored over a $1.1 trillion measure to keep the government operating past midnight Thursday. The officials said the goal of the secretive pension talks was to preserve benefits as much as possible and avert bankruptcies at troubled plans that could in turn endanger the stability of the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. Few details of the proposed changes under discussion were available. Republicans and Democrats on the House Education and Workforce Committee issued a statement that said lawmakers “are still discussing the details about a possible legislative solution to the multiemployer pension crisis and remain hopeful Congress will act before the end of the year.” Proposed changes have the support of many of the multiemployer pension plans in financial difficulty, but has drawn opposition from other, healthier entities. The officials who provided further information did so on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to pre-empt a formal announcement. The PBGC website says multiemployer plans result from collective bargaining between a labor union and more than one company. The issue was among numerous items affecting the final shape of the spending measure, one of a handful of must-pass items clogging the agenda for lawmakers eager to adjourn for the new year.  Others were bills to extend dozens of expiring tax breaks, authorize President Barack Obama’s policy of arming Syrian rebels to fight Islamic State forces and a Democratic drive to confirm as many administration nominees as possible before the Republicans take control of the Senate in January. Legislation to continue preventing state or local governments from imposing a tax on Internet access also seems likely to make it to Obama’s desk. There was relatively little controversy over spending levels themselves in what was shaping up as a classic year-end measure that rolled numerous unrelated issues into a single package. The $1.1 trillion in total spending adhered to spending caps approved in previous negotiations between Obama and House Republicans. It included more than $5 billion of the $6.2 billion the president requested to fight Ebola at home and overseas. The money would be available to keep the government running through the Sept. 30, 2015, end of the fiscal year, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security programs. Even failure to complete work before Thursday at midnight would not lead to a government shutdown, since lawmakers were prepared to pass a stopgap bill for a day or two to make sure there was no interruption in federal services. Unlike the rest of the government, enough funds were made available for the Homeland Security Department only until late winter. Republicans hope that will allow them to use their new leverage to force Obama to roll back his decision suspending the threat of deportation for millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Even before then, some conservatives sought to use the year-end funding measure to try and force a presidential retreat. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., complained the legislation “will allow the president to move money around to fund his executive amnesty program.” He said he hoped Congress would prevent it. Business-friendly Republicans were largely united behind efforts to roll back government regulations affecting the trucking industry, financial sector, federally-funded school lunch program and more in what shaped up as something of a dress rehearsal for next year, when the GOP controls both houses of Congress. Democratic officials said they had rejected several proposals to ease environmental regulations, and the fate of other attempts was unclear. Among them was an attempt to ease a regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association requiring truckers to take a 34-hour rest break at least once every seven days and that it span two periods between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. In a blog post, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the regulation had been upheld in court, and said efforts to overturn it “will put lives at risk.” Supporters of a change in the new rule included Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, as well as numerous lawmakers in both parties, and outside groups warned that the 2011 rule would result in more trucks in traffic when commuters and morning school buses were on the road. Officials said Republicans also sought a suspension of new school lunch program requirements supported by first lady Michelle Obama that require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains while limiting sodium, sugar and fat. Some school nutrition directors have lobbied for a break, saying the rules have proven to be costly and restrictive. Also on the table was an attempt to ease some of the requirements in legislation that regulated the financial industry in the wake of the economy’s near collapse. Republicans sought to include them as part of a bargain with Democrats seeking a renewal of legislation that requires the federal government to assume some of the insurance risk in losses arising from terrorism. Without a renewal, the terrorism reinsurance program will lapse at year’s end. Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Joan Lowy contributed to this report.

Americans take stock of shutdown’s everyday effects,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. You and your loved ones aren’t federal employees or contractors, and you don’t live in a setting or have a job closely tied to government programs. So what does the government shutdown have to do with you? More than you might think. Washington’s doings, or not-doings, can be woven into everyday American life from a bowl of breakfast cereal to a bottle of beer after work. The budget standoff between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats is rippling into some unexpected places. Like Carmen Bush’s cellphone. It’s being deluged with telemarketing calls, but she can’t get added to the National Do Not Call Registry. It is unavailable during the stalemate. “It’s turning into an every-15-minute reminder that the government is shut down,” the Oakland, California, high school English teacher says. “I feel bad because I know so many other people are being affected by the shutdown in so many more devastating ways, but this is just one way that didn’t even cross my mind.” Here’s a look at some more ways: ON YOUR PLATE Caitlin Hilbert was enjoying some poke, the Hawaiian marinated raw fish dish, last week when the shutdown made her stop chewing. It occurred to her that the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees seafood safety, had suspended routine inspections. The agency said last Monday it was bringing workers back to resume checks of seafood and other “high-risk” items. Still, the moment made Hilbert reflect on the links between Washington and her life in San Mateo, California.  “I want to be able to consume food without worry,” the college student and illustrator says. The FDA oversees about three-quarters of the food supply, from fresh vegetables to dry cereal. The agency conducts about 8,400 domestic-food inspections a year, about a third involving “high-risk” food. The agency said some checks — on imported food, for instance — have continued through the shutdown; so have U.S. Department of Agriculture inspections of meat and poultry. To be sure, inspectors don’t normally examine every morsel Americans eat, and plenty of food is safe. “The odds that you, as a consumer, will go in and pick up a box of food that was affected by the shutdown are low,” says Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food safety advocacy group. “But particularly as the shutdown goes on, the chances increase that someone in America is going to get sick who wouldn’t have gotten sick, because of the shutdown.” THE COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT After enduring past shutdowns as a federal worker, Atlanta retiree David Swan hoped he wouldn’t feel the effects of this one. Then he tried to look at an identity theft complaint he filed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2017, after his personal information was compromised in a data breach and he learned that someone checked into a hotel under his name. Swan recently got an email saying his FTC account would be deactivated if he didn’t log in, but the system is offline because of the shutdown. (The commission does say accounts aren’t being deactivated in the meantime.) “The process of keeping the government open and keeping the government running should not be compromised for partisan politics,” he says. IN THE LUNCHROOM The shutdown is showing up in school cafeterias in North Carolina’s rural Vance County, which plans to start paring student lunches this week. Fresh produce will be nixed in middle and high schools and reduced in elementary schools, and lunchrooms will stop offering bottled water and juice, among other changes announced in a Facebook post this week. Ice cream will be gone, too. The USDA assures that school lunch programs have funding through the end of March. But the Vance County school system said it’s trying “to conserve food and funding” in a district where most students come from families with incomes low enough to qualify them for free or reduced-price lunch. Federal money pays for 95 percent of its school nutrition program. “All indications are that as far as food supply and funding, we are OK through March. But beyond that, we really don’t know,” so administrators want to stretch what they have, spokeswoman Terri Hedrick said. The USDA said in a statement Thursday that officials “understand that the current lapse in appropriations creates uncertainty for the future,” but they’re hopeful the budget stalemate will end soon. IN TAX TANGLES Tax Day isn’t until April, but some of Mindy Schwartz’ accounting clients are anxious to contact the IRS now. They’ve gotten notices citing issues with past returns and saying the clients owe money. Normally, Schwartz calls up a special Internal Revenue Service number for tax professionals to get to the bottom of notices like this. But the line is now answered only by a message saying help “is not available at this time.” Help may be on the way: The IRS said was recalling about 46,000 of its employees, over half its workforce, as the official start of tax season approaches Jan. 28. The agency said workers would start staffing some phone lines “in the coming days.” For the moment, Schwartz’s concerned clients can only ponder whether to wait to get through, and perhaps risk penalties and interest, or pay what the IRS says they owe, even if they believe there’s an error. “Getting communications from the IRS tends to freak people out, so when you can’t get them an answer, it gets a little scary,” says Schwartz, of Carlsbad, California. AT THE AIRPORT Jennifer Lyon-Weisman isn’t a worrier by nature. But she headed for the airport in Columbus, Ohio, over three hours before her Friday afternoon flight. She lives only 15 minutes away, but she didn’t want to take chances on her annual trip to a fundraising music festival in New Jersey. She’d heard reports of long lines and closed checkpoints at some airports, starting last weekend, after absenteeism spiked among now-unpaid federal security screeners. The sick-out rate has eased a bit, and the Transportation Security Agency said less than 6 percent of flyers nationwide waited more than 14 minutes in checkpoint lines as of Thursday. But with a holiday weekend likely to boost crowds, Lyon-Weisman was concerned. “And then I feel guilty because people aren’t being paid, and it’s a really small problem,” said Lyon-Weisman, a barber. In the end, the airport crowds were light and screening went swiftly, she said. While security screeners and air traffic controllers have been told to keep working, Federal Aviation Administration safety inspectors weren’t, until the agency began recalling some Jan. 12. About 2,200 of the more than 3,000 inspectors are now on the job, overseeing work done by airlines, aircraft manufacturers and repair shops. The government says they’re doing critical work but forgoing such tasks as issuing new pilot certificates. Meanwhile, passengers will probably have to wait a bit longer to check out Delta’s newest jet model, a 109-seater the airline says has “among the widest seats” among single-aisle planes. CEO Ed Bastian said the Jan. 31 launch date will likely be pushed back because of certification delays amid the shutdown. ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES Some college students and their families are also contending with shutdown woes as they try to get tax information for financial aid applications. With IRS phone lines and offices closed, some have struggled to get verification and documents they need to apply. The shutdown doesn’t affect the aid itself, but the Department of Education acknowledges that some “systems and processes depend on information from_and actions taken by_other federal agencies, several of which are currently closed.” Reynold Verret, the president of Xavier University of Louisiana, says some students at his Catholic, historically black New Orleans school have been caught up in the quandary. “We’re not exceptional. Every university in the United States right now is probably facing that, as well,” he said. FROM THE TAP Money isn’t the only thing that’s not flowing during the shutdown. Some craft breweries are postponing new beer releases or expansions because they need permission from a federal agency that isn’t open. Such breweries tend to offer new seasonal and special brews frequently, and new beer labels need the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau’s approval to be sold across state lines. Milwaukee-based Lakefront Brewery, for one, has upcoming cherry lager and apple ale releases that could be delayed while it waits for the label-approval process to resume. Some other breweries have new locations idling while waiting for permits from the bureau. “To me, it kind of drives home to everybody what’s all happening and how many people are affected,” says Russ Klisch, Lakefront’s founder and president. “The government does touch everyone’s life, one way or another.” Associated Press writers Alina Hartounian in Phoenix; Ivan Moreno in Milwaukee; Skip Foreman in Charlotte, North Carolina; Rebecca Santana in New Orleans; and Kiley Armstrong in New York contributed to this report.

Fast-food fan Trump could remake healthy school lunches,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — Will Donald Trump remake school lunches into his fast-food favorites of burgers and fried chicken when he’s president? Children grumbling about healthier school meal rules championed by first lady Michelle Obama may have reason to cheer Trump’s election as the billionaire businessman is a proud patron of Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s while promising to curb federal regulations. The Obama administration has made healthier, safer and better labeled food a priority in the last eight years, significantly raising the profile of food policy and sometimes drawing the ire of Republicans, farmers and the food industry. The first lady made reducing childhood obesity one of her signature issues through her “Let’s Move” campaign. In addition to the healthier school meal rules, the administration ushered a sweeping food safety law through Congress, pushed through several new food labeling regulations, started to phase out trans fats, added calorie labels to menus and suggested new limits on sodium in packaged foods. The White House has also fended off efforts in the Republican Congress to trim the nation’s food stamp program. “Food advocates are already nostalgic for the Obama era and will be playing defense for the next four years,” says Sam Kass, a former White House senior adviser on nutrition and personal chef for the Obamas. A look at some of the food regulations that could be scrapped — or tweaked — in the new administration:  MAKING SCHOOL MEALS GREAT AGAIN Trump himself hasn’t weighed in on school meal regulations. But Republicans, school nutrition directors and some in the food industry have balked at parts of the administration’s rules that set stricter fat, sugar and sodium limits, among other standards, on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many students and schools have now gotten used to the healthier foods, some still complain that the standards are costly and difficult to meet. “I would be very surprised if we don’t see some major changes on the school lunch program” and some other food issues, said Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the Republican chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees Agriculture Department spending. Aderholt, who sits on Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, says the Obama administration’s approach was “activist driven” and people who voted for Trump are looking for a more common-sense approach. Legislation is pending in both the House and Senate to revise some of the standards, and will likely be considered again next year. USDA could also make some changes on its own. One of many names that have been floated as a possible agriculture secretary is Sid Miller, the Texas Agriculture Commissioner who repealed a state ban on deep fryers and soda machines at schools. Miller recently got in trouble when he used a profanity on Twitter to describe Democrat Hillary Clinton; he blamed a staffer and the tweet was deleted. THE FOOD POLICE In September, the Trump campaign pitched rolling back food safety regulations in a fact sheet, arguing they are burdensome to farmers and criticizing increased inspections of food manufacturing facilities as “overkill.” The sheet referred to the “food police” at the Food and Drug Administration. The campaign later deleted the proposal from its website. Congress passed new food safety regulations in 2010, a year after a salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut company killed nine people. Michael Taylor, former FDA deputy commissioner for foods who oversaw the food safety rules, says it wouldn’t be popular with consumers to roll them back. “Consumers are only getting more focused on safety, health and wellness,” Taylor says. Trump himself is a self-professed germaphobe who prefers eating at fast-food restaurants because he believes they have higher food safety standards. FOOD STAMPS Congressional Republicans have been examining food stamps since the program’s cost grew to almost $80 billion annually after the recession. Participation and costs have dipped since its 2013 high, but conservatives have suggested tightening eligibility standards or increasing work requirements. House Speaker Paul Ryan has for years championed an overhaul to the program. Democrats in the Senate have consistently objected to any changes, and will still wield influence. But they won’t have the backing of a Democratic White House. OTHER FOOD POLICY Many other laws are either already in place or close to it, including a revised “nutrition facts” panel on the back of food packages, with a new line breaking out added sugars, a labeling law for genetically modified foods and calorie labeling on restaurant and supermarket menus. In many cases, the rules are a result of compromise with industry. Kass says that pulling back may just create more cost and uncertainty for businesses. “Unwinding things is really hard, especially when most of them have been implemented and industry has moved on,” Kass says. He predicts most of the regulations will stay, but that there will be little additional progress. Ongoing administration efforts to reduce sodium in food and antibiotics in meat could be casualties. Margo Wootan, a lobbyist on nutrition issues for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says advocates will continue to be aggressive at the state and local levels, hoping change will bubble up. “The public is more interested than ever in nutrition and will continue to press companies,” she says.

School district aims to recoup school lunch debts,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — When hungry students line up with their lunch trays in school cafeterias next week, they’ll be invited to fill their plates with a heaping hot lunch — even if they owe $50 or $500 on their accounts. That generosity is because of a new state law that bans schools from stigmatizing children for having debt, a practice commonly known as “lunch shaming.” The law, passed late last year, says any communication about money owed on meal accounts has to be done between school officials and parents, and not involve the student. But sometimes parents don’t respond to requests for money owed, local school districts have found. Since the law was passed, meal debt in Lehigh Valley school districts has jumped, particularly in the Bethlehem Area School District. In the past, districts had a limit on how many meals students could receive with a negative account; districts can no longer do that. Bethlehem Area parents may have racked up more debt than parents in any other Lehigh Valley district, $154,590 — a 50 percent jump since the law went into effect. More than 3,370 accounts owe money to the district — with seven students owing more than $1,000 each. District officials say they have tried everything to recoup the money — sending weekly notices to parents after five unpaid meals; providing information on how to apply for free and reduced lunch; even setting up reimbursement plans where families can pay as little as $5 a week. As a last resort, the district has contracted with a collections agency to contact the 600 or so households that have a lunch debt of $50 or more.  “It’s not our intention to go after the families who are actively making an attempt to pay,” Bethlehem Area’s Chief Financial Officer Stacy Gober said at an August board meeting. “These are accounts that are sitting stale with no communication, no response, no visible cooperation to make good on the balance they have with the district.” “It may sound harsh,” she said, “but students very quickly know when they go to McDonald’s or Wawa, they have to pay.” Other school districts contacted by The Morning Call also reported an increase in meal debt since the law was passed. Saucon Valley’s increased five-fold, to $2,400; Northampton Area’s increased by almost 20 percent, to $9,842; Parkland’s more than doubled, to $11,179; and Quakertown’s almost tripled, to $11,246. Almost 20 percent of students in the Salisbury School District have an unpaid lunch balance, leaving the district with $4,523 in meal debt. Starting this school year, the district will forward those accounts to a local magistrate to collect. Lunch debt isn’t an issue in the Allentown School District, where all students receive free and reduced lunches because of the district’s high poverty rate. Easton Area’s lunch debt was $70,198 before the school district wrote it off this summer. In the past, districts would provide students who had debt with an alternative meal, such as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, that effectively broadcast their debt. That is no longer allowed; all students must be offered the meal available that day. The law also bars schools from allowing students to work off debt by doing chores. Before the new law, districts sometimes gave children with outstanding lunch debt a peanut butter and jelly sandwish, a practice known as “lunch-shaming.” (AL BEHRMAN / AP) It’s not just in Pennsylvania that districts are seeing lunch debt rise. A survey released this month by the national School Nutrition Association found that 75 percent of school districts racked up unpaid meal debt at the end of the 2016-17 school year. “We have heard of schools that have struggled with meal debt as a result of changing policies,” said Diane Pratt-Heavnek, the association’s director. No child should go to school hungry, she said, while acknowledging that unpaid lunch bills put a strain on schools because there is no “pot of money” that pays for those lunches. Stale accounts At Monday’s meeting, the Bethlehem Area School Board voted 7-0 to approve a two-year contract with Transworld Systems Inc. of Bethlehem at a fixed rate of $11.25 per each account pursued. The company will contact parents who owe $50 or more and have not made attempts to pay their debt. School board President Michael Faccinetto agrees the district needs to do something to collect the debt, but said he’s concerned about working families that struggle financially yet don’t meet the threshold for free and reduced lunch. “I don’t want to say that everybody is able to pay the debt,” Faccinetto said. Free and reduced-price meals, funded by the Agriculture Department’s National School Lunch Program, are provided to children whose families meet certain income thresholds. A family of four would have to earn less than $32,630 a year to qualify for free lunch, or less than $46,435 to get discounted meals. Households with slightly higher incomes are more likely to struggle, experts on poverty and nutrition say. Nearly 60 percent of Bethlehem’s 14,000 students qualify for free and reduced meals. Every year, the district sends notices explaining how families can sign up for them. The district also has a link on its website where parents can access the application in English or Spanish. Superintendent Joseph Roy said most eligible families are signed up for the program. Daily lunch costs $2.65 for an elementary student and $2.85 at the secondary level in Bethlehem. Reduced lunch is 40 cents for all grade levels. It’s hard to determine why families aren’t paying the bills. Some may be financially struggling and don’t qualify for lunch discounts, others may qualify but haven’t applied for the free lunch program, and some may be ignoring the debt. Pratt-Heavner said some qualifying families still struggle to cover the cost of reduced-priced lunches. If a family has four children, she noted, they would be paying $8 a week for lunches. And there may be undocumented immigrants who don’t apply because they don’t feel comfortable leaving a paper trail, she said. Fountain Hill Elementary, where 90 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged, has the highest lunch debt — $10,828 — among Bethlehem Area’s 16 elementary schools. Hanover Elementary, one of the district’s wealthier schools, has the lowest, at $400. But poverty doesn’t always align with high lunch debt. Governor Wolf Elementary in Bethlehem, which also is in one of the more affluent parts of the district, has one of the larger debts, at $6,373. The bottom line, district officials say, is that families need to let the school know they’re struggling financially. “If you’ve gotten notification every year that your student has outstanding debt and you’ve failed to address it, that’s grossly delinquent,” Gober said. “You need to be reaching out and saying, ‘OK, I can’t afford to pay the whole amount today, but I am willing to pay you so much a week in order to get caught up.’ ” Other options East Penn took a different approach when its lunch debt started to skyrocket in the spring. A group of district residents, including School Director Ziad Munson, launched an online fundraiser to cover the unpaid meals. The group raised almost $2,300 and covered the full debt. Munson said he and concerned parents have been discussing other ways to end meal debt. In Saucon Valley, where parents receive weekly emails when their child’s account is in the red, a donations accounts program has helped. If a student’s account has some extra money in it, they may donate the surplus to the district to offset the negative accounts, Superintendent Craig Butler said. At a school board meeting this month, Bethlehem Area director Eugene McKeon suggested that the district also consider not allowing students with debt to participate in graduation ceremonies. That may be allowed under the new law, which states that a district may restrict the privileges of students who owe money for school meals. But Roy said that isn’t an option the district would take.

The Latest: Irma-displaced students can take virtual classes,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. MIAMI (AP) — The Latest on Florida schools reopening and power outages remaining as state recovers from Hurricane Irma (all times local): 6 p.m. Florida students displaced by Hurricane Irma will be able to take virtual classes so they don’t fall behind. Gov. Rick Scott announced Monday that Florida Virtual School will provide remote access to educational resources to all Florida students who were displaced by the massive storm. FLVS will also provide access to digital educational materials to help the hardest hit school districts as they work to return to normal operations. Many school districts were reopening Monday, with more set to reopen within the next week. Students unable to return to their home districts in the near future will be able to enroll in comparable FLVS classes and then re-enroll later at their old brick-and-mortar schools. 4:15 p.m. Florida Gulf Coast University in storm-struck Fort Myers is holding graduation in December after all. The school thought it would need to push the commencement ceremony back to possibly January because of the impact of Hurricane Irma on its academic calendar and questions as to whether the on-campus Alico Arena could host such an event. But FGCU President Mike Martin says a deal was struck to hold the commencement in smaller bites, doing so by college. So the originally scheduled Dec. 16 date is back on. Martin says with help of student body president Jalisa White and others, “we’ve got a solution that ought to be acceptable to the vast majority.”  Noon The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has sent more than 700 employees to treat medical emergencies in areas impacted by Hurricane Irma. HHS Secretary Thomas Price visited Marathon in the hard-hit Florida Keys with Gov. Rick Scott on Monday. Price said he worried about problems polluted waters and carbon-monoxide poisoning may cause for people returning to the island chain. Residents were allowed to return throughout the Keys on Sunday, a week after Irma struck. Monroe County’s director of emergency management, Martin Senterfitt, says initial estimates show 20 percent of Florida Keys homes “are not livable right now.” In a tweet Monday morning, Monroe County officials said more than 19,000 Keys households have registered for disaster assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 11:30 a.m. Some Florida colleges are getting back to work after Hurricane Irma, while others will have to wait several more days. The University of Central Florida, in Orlando, has the state’s largest enrollment at around 66,000 students. Classes there resumed Monday and unlike some schools in the state, UCF won’t have to significantly alter its academic calendar for the fall semester. UCF is also making accommodations for students who were called up for National Guard duty. Barry University, based in Miami Shores, plans to resume classes on Tuesday. The University of Miami won’t have undergraduate classes until next week, and already has called off its fall break to help make up for lost time. Florida International is working on its revised schedule, one that will have an extra week of classes tacked onto the original plan. 10:04 a.m. Hundreds of thousands of Floridians are still without power more than a week after Hurricane Irma slammed into the state. The state’s emergency management division reported Monday that more than 407,000 homes and businesses are still without electricity. That’s nearly 4 percent of all utility accounts in the state. Large numbers of people in the badly-damaged Florida Keys as well as those in southwest Florida are still in the dark. Nearly 30 percent of homes and businesses in both Collier and Monroe counties remain without power. Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility, said it will take until Friday to restore electricity to most homes in southwest Florida. Nearly 53,000 customers in Miami-Dade County are still without electricity as well. 10:30 a.m. At least 48 county school districts in Florida will be serving free breakfast and lunch to all students through Oct. 20 as classes resume after Hurricane Irma. More counties may be added to that list in the coming days. In a statement Monday, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam said the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved a plan to make meals available to the students in those 48 counties through the National School Lunch Program. The counties include the hardest-hit by Irma: Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe and Collier. State officials say as many as 3,000 schools and 2.5 million students may benefit from the plan. 8:30 a.m. Miami-area students have returned to school amid ongoing Hurricane Irma cleanups. Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho tweeted late Sunday that power and air conditioning had been restored to all schools. One middle school remained closed Monday for cleaning. Early Monday, Carvalho tweeted that welcoming students back to class was “a step toward normalcy.” Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie told the Sun Sentinel that all students will be offered free breakfast and lunch for several weeks. In the Florida Keys, Monroe County Schools Superintendent Mark Porter aims to have students back in class on Sept. 25. Students in southwestern Florida also will miss another week of school. Collier County school district officials told the Naples Daily News on Friday that staff and school buildings were still struggling with power outages, sewage backups and repairs. 7:40 a.m. Miami-Dade and Broward counties will reopen schools the first time since before Hurricane Irma threatened to hit South Florida. The schools in both counties are scheduled to open Monday. The Miami Herald reports one school in Miami-Dade County still doesn’t have power. Air conditioning may work on one part of campus, but not another. Power might blip on and off through the day. Broward officials say power has been restored to all schools there. As in Broward, Miami-Dade schools will offer not only the free breakfast available to all students, but a free lunch until further notice. All tardies and absences for Monday will be considered excused. Wednesday remains an early release day. Thursday is a teacher planning day, which falls on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

"2017 Election Questionnaire: Eric Jones, candidate for Sycamore District 427 School Board","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Sycamore School District 427 School Board candidate Eric Jones submitted this questionnaire, answering the Daily Chronicle’s questions in the 2017 Sycamore District 427 School Board race. Name: Eric Jones Age: 36 Town: Sycamore Office sought: Sycamore District 427 Board Questions 1) Why are you running for school board? Being a school board member provides the opportunity to have a voice in the direction and quality of the system responsible for providing my children with their most important asset, their education. By taking an active role, it requires me to focus my efforts on making sure that our community makes the best use of its resources and maintains the integrity and transparency that community members need and deserve. 2) What makes you the best candidate? Having been educated in a variety of school districts, including both public and private institutions, I have a diverse background to draw from. I come from a profession deeply rooted in analytical thinking, and I spend a lot of time trying to understand the “why” and the “how” of any situation in order to achieve the best outcome for all stakeholders. I’m not shy about asking questions when an issue seems confusing or not thoroughly explained. With no family employed by the school district, I bring an outside perspective to any discussion. 3) What, if anything, can the school board do to reduce the tax burden on homeowners? With more than 81% of the school’s budget allocated for personnel and benefits, we need to work closely with our valued staff to achieve a sustainable compensation and benefits program that fairly compensates all teachers and administrators while respecting the budgetary constraints of the local and state economies. Furthermore, we must continue to look at the funding models of our extracurricular and elective programs to make sure that any resources being spent on those programs are fairly balanced with the opportunity they provide while acknowledging the existence of alternative programs that may be better suited for providing those opportunities.  Lastly, we must continue to apply pressure on the state legislators, through our respective professional organizations, to eliminate costly and unfunded state mandates. 4) The school district has run deficits in the millions in each of the past five school years. How will you evaluate future district budgets? Deficit reductions have been a goal quite some time, with a slow and measured reduction in costs across the district. The goal of this approach was to limit the effects of a severe budget adjustment that would materially affect the quality of the education provided by the district while awaiting a hopeful uptick in economic conditions following the severe budget impact of the 2007 to 2009 recession. Unfortunately, economic recovery has been slow and the need for more aggressive action led to the current three-year reduction plan. Accelerated growth in benefit costs and the lack of flexibility afforded by four-year negotiated contracts with staff provided few options for achieving a balanced budget. This year will mark the first truly balanced budget since I joined the school board four years ago, and future budgets will be strictly managed to continue cost-reduction efforts in order to build up depleted fund balances and avoid the issuance of costly tax anticipation warrants. 5) As a school board member, how will you approach teacher contract negotiations? The collective bargaining agreement represents the single largest expense line item on the budget, and as such requires careful and deliberate consideration by all parties. Fair compensation benefits the district and its learners by helping to retain high-quality learning facilitators that might otherwise seek employment with more competitive institutions. Retention of existing employees also benefits the district by bringing continuity to its various programs, contributing the growth momentum achieved in recent years and reflected in our rising standardized test scores. However, without achieving some creative revamping of existing contract, the district has limited options for controlling future expenses, as shown in the last two years of the budget reduction plan. My approach is to make sure that the contract reflects the respect we have for our educators, provides for competitive and equitable compensation, and limits expenditure growth to a level that is commensurate with the growth of the local economy. 6) Some students who live in town spend as much as an hour on the bus on their way to school. Do you support this? Having never been educated in a school district that was required to provide busing, it was a somewhat foreign concept to me when I first joined the board. The district is required by the state to provide transportation to students who live outside of a predefined radius from their home school, or for those who would otherwise not be able to safely get themselves to their school. The state is supposed to provide funding for that program but has been notoriously delinquent in those responsibilities. Given the large number of miles driven by our buses and the sheer number of students we’re required to service, it hasn’t been unusual for the district to allocate $500,000 for new buses each year, and that doesn’t include the costs associated with maintaining the existing bus fleet, hiring drivers, and purchasing fuel. We continually look for creative ways to reduce the time and length of bus routes, including current efforts centered around a possible restructuring of school start times. I fully support finding ways to reduce bus transit times, but they must not contribute to the deficit and I would encourage parents to consider carpooling where possible. 7) What other civic involvement have you had? What have you learned from that experience? Serving as a school board member for the last four years reflects my first term in an elected role; however, I am involved with other local service organizations, such as Rotary. Being a board member is a life-changing experience that has provided a much-needed outlet for my desire to contribute to my local community. The perceptions I had upon starting on the board flew in the face of the reality of what the school district is required to do, and I quickly found myself having to rapidly get up to speed on topics ranging from special education to school lunch programs. Now, as I approach the end of my term, I feel like I’m just starting to reach my full potential, and with the community’s support, would find great honor in continuing that service.

FCC head unveils proposal to narrow ‘digital divide’,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) — The head of the Federal Communications Commission is proposing that the government agency expand a phone subsidy program for the poor to include Internet access. The FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, has emphasized that Internet access is a critical component of modern life, key education, communication and finding a keeping a job. With the net neutrality rules released earlier this year, the agency redefined broadband as a public utility, like the telephone, giving it stricter oversight on how online content gets to consumers. That triggered lawsuits from Internet service providers. The proposal Thursday to expand the Lifeline phone program to Internet service aims to narrow the “digital divide” — those with access to the Internet and other modern technologies and those without. According to a Pew Research Center report from 2013, 70 percent of U.S. adults have a high-speed Internet connection at home. Only 54 percent of households earnings less than $30,000 a year do. The FCC says low-income Americans are more likely to rely on smartphones for Internet access. According to the Pew report, 67 percent of households that make less than $30,000 a year have home broadband or a smartphone. Lifeline was started in 1985 and expanded to include wireless phones in 2005. The FCC’s proposal calls for extending Lifeline’s $9.25 monthly credit to give low-income households a choice of phone service or Internet access, via a wire to the home or a smartphone. “Voice is no longer sufficient to be able to participate in society today,” said Harold Feld of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. “The broad assumption is that you’ve got broadband access somehow.”  But Lifeline has been criticized for being susceptible to fraud, and the proposal may get pushback from Republicans. The FCC’s proposal says it will build on anti-fraud measures that were put in place in 2012, such as extending the period that providers must keep documents on customers’ eligibility for the programs. Senator David Vitter, R-La., said in a statement Thursday that the FCC has “failed to manage Lifeline efficiently in its current form, and I cannot support any expansion of a program that has so few safeguards in place to protect the legitimacy of the program and the American taxpayers who pay into it.” FCC commissioners will vote in June on whether to proceed with expanding Lifeline to broadband service. In 2014, Lifeline served 12 million households and cost $1.7 billion, paid for by surcharges on the country’s telephone customer bills. Eligibility depends on income being at or less than 135 percent of the federal government’s poverty line, or participation in programs including Medicaid, food stamps or free school lunch. As Internet access is often more expensive than $9.25 a month, program participants may have to pay an additional amount for service. Some broadband providers already offer low-cost Internet to households that get food stamps or are in the school lunch program. But Comcast’s $10-a-month Internet Essentials program, for example, has been criticized as having too-slow speeds of up to 5 megabits per second and for too few people being eligible. The FCC defines broadband as having download speeds of 25 megabits per second and higher. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Chelsea Clinton quits as NBC News reporter,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK (AP) — Chelsea Clinton said Friday she is quitting her job as a reporter at NBC News, citing increased work at the Clinton Foundation and the imminent birth of her first child. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton’s daughter had been working at the network since 2011, sporadically doing feature stories on people or organizations doing public-spirited work. Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying her $600,000 a year. “I loved watching the ‘Making a Difference’ stories about remarkable people and organizations making a profound difference in our country and our world,” Clinton said in a statement posted on her Facebook page. “I am grateful NBC gave me the opportunity to continue this important legacy.” She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams’ “Rock Center” newsmagazine, but that program was canceled. Her work occasionally appeared on NBC’s “Nightly News.” Two Clinton stories that aired in January were on education programs targeting the underprivileged. She’s done stories on a school program for jailed teenagers named after Maya Angelou, an Arkansas tutoring program and a restaurant chain that donates leftover food to the needy. Her story on actor Jeff Bridges’ work on childhood hunger aired Aug. 1, and another story about a school lunch program for poor children in New Mexico is scheduled to air this Sunday. “Chelsea’s storytelling inspired people across the country and showcased the real power we have as individuals to make a difference in our communities,” said Alex Wallace, senior vice president at NBC News.  Her exit removes some potential awkwardness for the network if her mother runs for president in 2016. NBC made certain to keep Clinton off the air around the time her mother was making media appearances to promote a book, to avoid any appearance of conflict. NBC also received some criticism when stories about her salary appeared; the network didn’t comment on the reports. Both Wallace and Clinton left open the possibility that Clinton could someday return to NBC. “While my role with NBC News may be coming to an end, I look forward to working with the NBC family well into the future,” Clinton said on Facebook. Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, announced this spring that she is pregnant with her first child. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A first lady who followed her own path more than precedent,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — When Michelle Obama considered the daunting prospect of becoming first lady, she avoided turning to books by her predecessors for guidance. Instead, she turned inward. “I didn’t want to be influenced by how they defined the role,” Mrs. Obama once said. She instinctively knew she had to define the job “very uniquely and specifically to me and who I was.” That meant doing it her way: shaping the role around her family, specifically her two young daughters, and not letting her new responsibilities consume her. Throughout her eight years, Mrs. Obama has been a powerful, if somewhat enigmatic, force in her husband’s White House. She chose her moments in the often unforgiving spotlight with great care and resisted pressure to become more engaged in the mudslinging of partisan politics. At times, she’s been more traditional than some expected — or wanted from this first lady. At other times, she’s been eager to update stuffy conventions associated with the office. As she navigated her way through, the woman who grew up on the South Side of Chicago discovered a talent for television and a comfort with Hollywood A-listers, haute couture and social media. And she used all of those elements to promote her causes — childhood obesity, support for military families, girls’ education — with at least some success. When she leaves the White House next month just a few days after celebrating her 53rd birthday, Mrs. Obama will do so not just as a political figure, but as a luminary with international influence.  Friends say she charted that path largely on her own. “What she did was she sort of listened to herself and allowed her own inner voice and strength and direction to lead her in the way that felt most authentic to her,” Oprah Winfrey told The Associated Press. “And I think watching somebody makes you want to do that for yourself.” Mrs. Obama grappled with the childhood obesity issue before becoming first lady; a doctor had warned her about her daughters’ weight. At the White House, she decided to share her experience with the country and started by planting the first vegetable garden there in more than 60 years. That led the following year, in 2010, to the launch of her anti-childhood-obesity initiative, “Let’s Move.” The first lady appealed to elected officials, food makers, sellers, restaurant chains and others to try to make healthy food more accessible. She lobbied lawmakers to add more fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and limit fat, sugar and sodium in the federal school lunch program. That led to the first update to the program in decades, and for Mrs. Obama the process was akin to a crash course in Washington sausage-making. Mrs. Obama’s effort was not universally welcomed. Republicans in Congress wanted to reverse the rules. Others said Mrs. Obama was acting like the “food police.” Even the kids she wanted to help added to the backlash. Some students posted photos of lunches they found unappealing on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, or simply tossed the food into the trash. Mrs. Obama had won. But she would never again try to work closely with Congress on an issue. She chose instead to use her platform to press industry to change its ways. It’s too early to know how Mrs. Obama’s efforts may affect childhood obesity rates long term, but advocates believe she helped change the national dialogue around healthy eating. And although incoming Republican President Donald Trump, a proud patron of McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken, has yet to comment on school meal regulations, advocates worry about the fate of Mrs. Obama’s effort under a White House and Congress that will be controlled by the GOP. Reflecting on her childhood obesity work, Mrs. Obama said some people initially wondered why she would bother with such a “softball issue” but “now, all those challenges and criticisms are off the table.” She told talk-show host Rachael Ray that “at least we’ve become very aware as a society that this is one of our most important health issues.” Mrs. Obama’s push to put the country on a health kick extended to exercise — and she made herself exhibit A. To promote “Let’s Move,” the first lady often donned athletic wear and ran around with kids at sports clinics, some on the South Lawn. She twirled a hula hoop around her waist 142 times and kick-boxed in a video of the gym workout that helped tone the upper arms she showed off regularly, as in her official White House photo. She did pushups with Ellen DeGeneres, raced in a potato sack against late-night TV’s Jimmy Fallon in the East Room and shimmied with a turnip in a brief video popular on social media — all to show that exercise can be fun. “I’m pretty much willing to make a complete fool of myself to get our kids moving,” she once said. Instead of going the fool’s route, Mrs. Obama turned herself into a fitness guru and a figure significantly more popular than her husband. First lady was never a position Mrs. Obama imagined for herself, given her modest upbringing, her distaste for politics and having never seen her skin color on a U.S. president and first lady. Her early aversion to politics developed while watching her father navigate Chicago politics for his job with the city water department, and was reinforced by her husband’s pursuit of a political career. Both Obamas have said his political ambition had strained their marriage and family. Once in the White House, Mrs. Obama vowed to protect her then 10- and 7-year-old daughters’ right to a normal childhood. She declared being “mom in chief” to Malia and Sasha as her priority, irking women who hoped the first lady might be less constrained by stereotypes. She showed few signs of trying to push those boundaries. Mrs. Obama was an enthusiastic White House hostess. She rarely spoke about issues that were outside of her portfolio. She crafted her public schedule around her daughters’ activities and limited her travel so she could spend time with them. The Obamas’ parenting style — often described by both Obamas as warm, but strict — made them role models on that front, a point of pride, particularly in the African-American community. “We have heard no Obama children drama,” said Ingrid Saunders Jones, national chairwoman of the National Council of Negro Women. Mrs. Obama didn’t really begin to open up about the historic nature of her service as the first black woman to become first lady until the end of the presidency was in sight. She mostly addressed the subject in interviews when she was asked to reflect about it, and discussed how important it was for children to see a black president and first lady. Longtime friend and White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said Mrs. Obama was often reluctant to talk about such matters earlier because she wanted her legacy to be more than just her place in history. “Her goal is not what she is, but what she does,” Jarrett said. In the final weeks of the presidential race, Mrs. Obama set aside her distaste for politics to wage one last campaign, an ultimately futile attempt to help elect Democrat Hillary Clinton. She quickly became one of most passionate Democratic voices opposing Trump and calling him out for “bragging about sexually assaulting women” in comments caught on a 2005 video. “I know it’s a campaign, but this isn’t about politics,” she said at a Clinton rally shown live on cable TV news, rare exposure for a first lady in a campaign. If Trump’s past words are “painful to us as grown women,” she asked, “what do you think this is doing to our children?” It was yet another moment when Mrs. Obama again seemed to be following her path rather than precedent.

High court says gov’t seizure of raisins is unconstitutional,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the government can’t force raisin farmers to give up part of their annual crop for less than it’s worth, a victory for conservative groups that hailed the decision as a win for private property rights. The justices ruled 8-1 that a 1940s-era program born out of the Great Depression is unconstitutional because it allows federal officials to seize personal property from farmers without fully compensating them, even though the goal is to benefit farmers by stabilizing market prices. The court sided with California farmers Marvin and Laura Horne, who claimed they were losing money under a program they called outdated and ineffective. They had been fined $695,000 for trying to get around it. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said the government must pay “just compensation” when it takes personal goods, just as when it takes land away. Roberts rejected the government’s argument that the Hornes voluntarily chose to participate in the raisin market and have the option of growing different crops if they don’t like it. “‘Let them sell wine’ is probably not much more comforting to the raisin growers than similar retorts have been to others throughout history,” Roberts said. “Property rights cannot be so easily manipulated.” The case was considered one of the most important property disputes to reach the high court since 2005, when the justices ruled that the city of New London, Connecticut, could use the power of eminent domain to hand private homes or businesses to developers to help stimulate economic improvement. That case sparked a backlash in many states and led more than 40 state legislatures to pass laws protecting property rights.  By contrast, Monday’s ruling in the raisin case was seen as a decisive win for property-rights advocates seeking to limit government power. “The decision confirms what should be obvious: the government cannot come and take your personal property without compensation, whether raisins or other property, on the ground that the taking is for your own good,” said J. David Breemer, attorney for the Pacific Law Foundation, a conservative group that backed the Hornes. The program was authorized by a 1937 law that allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture to keep prices for raisins and other crops steady by helping to manage supply. A 1949 marketing order allowed farmers to form a committee that decides how much of the raisin crop handlers must turn over to the government each year. These raisins would be placed into a reserve pool to be sold outside the open market, used for the school lunch program or given away to charities and foreign governments. Any profits from these reserve sales would go toward funding the committee and anything left over went back to the farmers. The Hornes refused to participate in the program in 2003, when farmers were required to give up 47 percent of their crop but received far less in return than their costs of production. They also refused to cooperate in 2004, when other farmers gave up 30 percent of the crop in 2004 and were paid nothing. The Hornes’ lawyer, John O’Quinn, called the ruling “a personal vindication” for the couple and “an important win for personal liberty.” Raisin prices have been stable recently, and farmers have not been ordered to put crops in reserve since 2010. Only a small number of other crops are regulated in the same way, though federal officials say most programs are not active. Those include California dried prunes, California dates, California almonds, tart cherries, walnuts and spearmint oil. A USDA spokesman said agency officials were reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment. Roberts said the government could have restricted raisin sales by limiting production, which is how the vast majority of crops programs work. In a separate opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer agreed that the Hornes were entitled to be properly paid for their crops, but he said the case should be sent back to a lower court to decide whether they would have been owed any money had they complied with the program. Breyer’s separate opinion was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Justice Clarence Thomas took issue with Breyer’s point and wrote separately to say that sending the case back to figure out compensation “in this case would be a fruitless exercise.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the only dissenter. She said the program did not deprive the Hornes of all property rights, it just limited the amount of potential income they could earn from it. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

India police arrest principal after 23 pupils die,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. PATNA, India (AP) — The principal of a primary school in eastern India where 23 children died last week after eating lunch prepared with contaminated oil was arrested Wednesday, nine days after she went into hiding, police said. Meena Kumari fled as soon as the children began falling ill after eating the lunch cooked at the school in Bihar state. Twenty-three children between the ages of 5 and 12 died after eating the meal and many others fell ill. Forensic tests have revealed that the lunch contained toxic levels of a deadly pesticide. A police team investigating the deaths arrested Kumari on Wednesday, and authorities were questioning her to establish how the pesticide got mixed with the food, said police superintendent Sujit Kumar. Bihar’s education minister, P.K. Sahi, has said the principal bought the ingredients for the meal from a shop owned by her husband, who has fled. The school’s cooks have told authorities that the principal controlled the food for the government-provided free daily lunch. One of the cooks said that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but that the principal told her to use it anyway. On Wednesday, Bihar’s chief minister and top elected official, Nitish Kumar, said the government would punish all those who were responsible for the tragedy. “No one will be spared,” Kumar told reporters, adding that state authorities were working to streamline the school lunch program to prevent the recurrence of such a mishap.  India’s midday meal plan is one of the world’s biggest school nutrition programs. State governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations. It was first introduced in the 1960s in southern India, where it was seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school. Since then, the program has been replicated across the country, covering some 120 million schoolchildren. It’s part of an effort to address concerns about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all Indian children suffer from. Although there have been complaints about the quality of the food served and the lack of hygiene, the incident in Bihar appeared to be unprecedented for the massive food program.

Comcast’s new pricing structure for internet usage has bite as new fees start Nov. 1 in Washington and around nation,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Heads up, Comcast internet customers. The same scheme that can explode your cellphone bill is coming to your home internet bill: Exceed your coverage plan, and you will pay a penalty. Effective Nov. 1, Washington state consumers who get home internet from Comcast will face a new pricing structure: Anyone who uses more than one terabyte of bandwidth per month will get additional charges on their monthly cable bill; Comcast automatically will bill for additional “blocks” of 50 gigabytes, at $10 per block. Above that 1 terabyte cap, Comcast will bill for as many extra “blocks” as a customer uses, up to a maximum of $200 per month. So what’s a terabyte? See the explainer box nearby. Comcast contends only 1 percent of its customers use enough bandwidth to be affected. But critics of this pricing method say usage will climb rapidly in the future, due to market trends such as higher-resolution TVs, cloud-backup plans for consumers’ data, the soaring size of computer-game downloads and the “cord cutter” movement. Cord cutters are among the harshest critics of Comcast’s internet use fee; they avoid rising fees for cable-channel packages by watching shows over the internet, via streaming. Yet as Comcast loses cable TV customers, it retains internet customers – who face the new bandwidth fees. According to Comcast, the reason for the use fee is “fairness.” Walter Neary, the company’s communications director for Washington, says the principle behind the new price is simple: “Use more, pay more.”  But fairness is in the eye of the beholder. Comcast’s data use fee will apply to video streamed from Comcast’s competitors, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The fee will not apply, according to Comcast, to most use of Comcast’s own streaming-via-internet service, StreamTV. In many areas, including Spokane, Comcast has a government-granted monopoly for internet via cable. Its primary competition is DSL internet via old-school telephone lines. But consumers for years have been shifting away from reliance on landline phone wires, choosing instead to rely on cellphones and voice-over-internet phone providers such as Ooma and Comcast. Consequently, those who feel jammed by Comcast’s near-monopoly might wish to ask: Who is looking out for the public interest in a competitive price? The answer? No one. According to Neary, it is only “the marketplace” that regulates Comcast’s prices. Regulation, to the extent it exists, comes from federal government and cities: The Federal Communication Commission regulates internet service providers. But FCC’s primary requirement is that pricing be “transparent” – in other words, charge whatever the market will bear; just label it clearly on the monthly bill. Cities grant Comcast the right to install and maintain the cables that deliver its internet service. But city franchise agreements are long-term deals that focus on enhancements like telephone-pole guy wires and local-access cable television channels – not on the rapidly evolving ways in which internet is used and priced. For example: Since the dawn of YouTube and its viral cat videos, how many people watch the homemade programs on local-access TV channels? In Spokane, it was 11 years ago that the city approved Comcast’s franchise to operate TV cables throughout the city. Eleven years ago, consumers still bought music on CDs, movies on DVDs, merchandise from brick-and-mortar stores and TV programming via take-it-or-leave-it bundles of cable channels. On-demand streaming by internet, in those days, was in its infancy. Comcast’s contract with the city will expire in December 2017. So far, city officials are in the earliest stage of discussing the renewal of that contract. They have hired Moss and Barnett, a Minnesota law firm, to do the negotiating. Formal talks have not begun. To the extent city officials have goals in the talks, they are talking about better internet access for low-income people, not the new fees for “internet hogs,” as one official put it. Will the public have a voice in city goals for the upcoming negotiations? Mayor David Condon said last week that public engagement “will be a key component.” But it’s too early, he said, to know what the public-comment opportunities will look like. Right now, the city is asking Moss and Barnett for advice on what legal authority the city has in making demands of Comcast. The last time the city negotiated with Comcast, it had a citizens advisory board. One of the members was John Waite, owner of Auntie’s Bookstore and Merlyn’s Comics and Games. The advisory group’s role, Waite said, “was pathetic.” “The city doesn’t really do any negotiating with the cable company. The cable company presents this thing and you go, ‘Wow, this is a lot of stuff,’ and you can’t read it all. In an advisory sense, you either approve it or disapprove it. “It’s hard because we don’t have competition here, we have a monopoly. With a monopoly, they (Comcast) just literally don’t have to do anything. Being a small-business guy, you can’t help but feel this way. I’m big on competition. I just don’t believe in monopolies,” Waite said. It takes so much investment to set up a cable infrastructure, he added, that a switch to another vendor might seem unlikely: “They build up these big facilities and there’s no way someone is going to pull the plug and change it.” City Council President Ben Stuckart said his priorities for the next Comcast franchise agreement will include expansion of internet service to low-income people. “To me it’s more about getting that access, rather than the guy who’s hogging all the bandwidth.” Comcast’s new pricing scheme, Stuckart said, only will affect “internet hogs that are sucking up the bandwidth.” To the extent access for low-income people becomes an issue, Comcast already has something to offer, according to its spokesman, Neary. Its “Internet Essentials” program offers internet service for $9.95 a month to homes with at least one child who qualifies for the national school lunch program. Stuckart, however, says he has more in mind and is looking for models in other cities that extend access to low-income neighborhoods and use public libraries or community centers to provide free internet service and training. He noted that the city of Spokane already installs empty internet conduit below ground whenever streets are repaved, as a way of preparing for a better-wired future. Like Stuckart, the Federal Communication Commission describes access to the internet as essential to modern society. President Obama and the FCC have approved an “open internet” policy – also known as “net neutrality.” The FCC’s open internet rules prohibit an earlier industry move toward bandwidth throttling for those who pay less, combined with “fast lanes” for those who pay more. Instead, the FCC contends openness, with transparent pricing, will encourage uninhibited innovation. But even though the “open” policy blocked the industry from charging more for higher speed, it appears that the policy opened the door for the industry to charge, instead, on the basis of volume as technology drives usage ever higher. Some communities do not rely on Comcast. Another leading vendor in the Inland Northwest is Spectrum Time Warner, which provides cable internet service to areas including Pullman and Coeur d’Alene. Spectrum does not impose usage-based fees, according to its website. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

That led the following year, in 2010, to the launch of her anti-childhood-obesity initiative, “Let’s Move.” The first lady appealed to elected officials, food makers, sellers, restaurant chains and others to try to make healthy food more accessible. She lobbied lawmakers to add more fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and limit fat, sugar and sodium in the federal school lunch program. That led to the first update to the program in decades, and for Mrs. Obama the process was akin to a crash course in Washington sausage-making. Mrs. Obama’s effort was not universally welcomed. Republicans in Congress wanted to reverse the rules. Others said Mrs. Obama was acting like the “food police.” Even the kids she wanted to help added to the backlash. Some students posted photos of lunches they found unappealing on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, or simply tossed the food into the trash. Mrs. Obama had won. But she would never again try to work closely with Congress on an issue. She chose instead to use her platform to press industry to change its ways. It’s too early to know how Mrs. Obama’s efforts may affect childhood obesity rates long term, but advocates believe she helped change the national dialogue around healthy eating. And although incoming Republican President Donald Trump, a proud patron of McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken, has yet to comment on school meal regulations, advocates worry about the fate of Mrs. Obama’s effort under a White House and Congress that will be controlled by the GOP. Reflecting on her childhood obesity work, Mrs. Obama said some people initially wondered why she would bother with such a “softball issue” but “now, all those challenges and criticisms are off the table.” She told talk-show host Rachael Ray that “at least we’ve become very aware as a society that this is one of our most important health issues.” Mrs. Obama’s push to put the country on a health kick extended to exercise — and she made herself exhibit A. To promote “Let’s Move,” the first lady often donned athletic wear and ran around with kids at sports clinics, some on the South Lawn. She twirled a hula hoop around her waist 142 times and kick-boxed in a video of the gym workout that helped tone the upper arms she showed off regularly, as in her official White House photo. She did pushups with Ellen DeGeneres, raced in a potato sack against late-night TV’s Jimmy Fallon in the East Room and shimmied with a turnip in a brief video popular on social media — all to show that exercise can be fun. “I’m pretty much willing to make a complete fool of myself to get our kids moving,” she once said. Instead of going the fool’s route, Mrs. Obama turned herself into a fitness guru and a figure significantly more popular than her husband. First lady was never a position Mrs. Obama imagined for herself, given her modest upbringing, her distaste for politics and having never seen her skin color on a U.S. president and first lady. Her early aversion to politics developed while watching her father navigate Chicago politics for his job with the city water department, and was reinforced by her husband’s pursuit of a political career. Both Obamas have said his political ambition had strained their marriage and family. Once in the White House, Mrs. Obama vowed to protect her then 10- and 7-year-old daughters’ right to a normal childhood. She declared being “mom in chief” to Malia and Sasha as her priority, irking women who hoped the first lady might be less constrained by stereotypes. She showed few signs of trying to push those boundaries. Mrs. Obama was an enthusiastic White House hostess. She rarely spoke about issues that were outside of her portfolio. She crafted her public schedule around her daughters’ activities and limited her travel so she could spend time with them. The Obamas’ parenting style — often described by both Obamas as warm, but strict — made them role models on that front, a point of pride, particularly in the African-American community. “We have heard no Obama children drama,” said Ingrid Saunders Jones, national chairwoman of the National Council of Negro Women. Mrs. Obama didn’t really begin to open up about the historic nature of her service as the first black woman to become first lady until the end of the presidency was in sight. She mostly addressed the subject in interviews when she was asked to reflect about it, and discussed how important it was for children to see a black president and first lady. Longtime friend and White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said Mrs. Obama was often reluctant to talk about such matters earlier because she wanted her legacy to be more than just her place in history. “Her goal is not what she is, but what she does,” Jarrett said. In the final weeks of the presidential race, Mrs. Obama set aside her distaste for politics to wage one last campaign, an ultimately futile attempt to help elect Democrat Hillary Clinton. She quickly became one of most passionate Democratic voices opposing Trump and calling him out for “bragging about sexually assaulting women” in comments caught on a 2005 video. “I know it’s a campaign, but this isn’t about politics,” she said at a Clinton rally shown live on cable TV news, rare exposure for a first lady in a campaign. If Trump’s past words are “painful to us as grown women,” she asked, “what do you think this is doing to our children?” It was yet another moment when Mrs. Obama again seemed to be following her path rather than precedent.

Michelle Obama: A first lady who charted her own course,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — When Michelle Obama considered the daunting prospect of becoming first lady, she avoided turning to books by her predecessors for guidance. Instead, she turned inward. “I didn’t want to be influenced by how they defined the role,” Mrs. Obama once said. She instinctively knew she had to define the job “very uniquely and specifically to me and who I was.” That meant doing it her way: shaping the role around her family, specifically her two young daughters, and not letting her new responsibilities consume her. Throughout her eight years, Mrs. Obama has been a powerful, if somewhat enigmatic, force in her husband’s White House. She chose her moments in the often unforgiving spotlight with great care and resisted pressure to become more engaged in the mudslinging of partisan politics. At times, she’s been more traditional than some expected — or wanted from this first lady. At other times, she’s been eager to update stuffy conventions associated with the office. As she navigated her way through, the woman who grew up on the South Side of Chicago discovered a talent for television and a comfort with Hollywood A-listers, haute couture and social media. And she used all of those elements to promote her causes — childhood obesity, support for military families, girls’ education — with at least some success. When she leaves the White House next month just a few days after celebrating her 53rd birthday, Mrs. Obama will do so not just as a political figure, but as a luminary with international influence.  Friends say she charted that path largely on her own. “What she did was she sort of listened to herself and allowed her own inner voice and strength and direction to lead her in the way that felt most authentic to her,” Oprah Winfrey told The Associated Press. “And I think watching somebody makes you want to do that for yourself.” Mrs. Obama grappled with the childhood obesity issue before becoming first lady; a doctor had warned her about her daughters’ weight.

2 ag-gag laws facing federal court challenges,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The years-long fight between farm organizations and animal rights activists over laws prohibiting secretly filmed documentation of animal abuse is moving from state legislatures to federal courts as laws in Utah and Idaho face constitutional challenges. Half of U.S. states have attempted to pass so-called ag-gag laws, but only seven have been successful. Among them are Idaho, where this year’s law says unauthorized recording is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine, and Utah, whose 2012 law makes it a crime to provide false information to gain access to a farm. Both states now face separate but similarly worded lawsuits that say the measures violate federal statutes offering whistleblower protections and free-speech guarantees. Farm organizations and livestock producers say ag-gag laws are aimed at protecting their homes and businesses from intruders, and some plan to use social media to assure the public they have nothing to hide. But animal rights groups, free-speech activists and investigative journalists want to throw out the laws because they say the secrecy puts consumers at higher risk of food safety problems and animals at higher risk of abuse. Numerous investigations have taken place on farms in the past decade, leading to “food safety recalls, citations for environmental and labor violations, evidence of health code violations, plant closures, criminal convictions, and civil litigation,” the Idaho lawsuit says. One such investigation was conducted by the Humane Society of the United States in Chino, California, in 2007, and led to the largest meat recall in U.S. history. Undercover video at a slaughterhouse showed cows too weak or sick to walk dragged by chains, rammed by forklifts and sprayed with high-pressure hoses. It was released after three attempts to get the facility’s USDA inspectors to do something, and the government ended up recalling 143 million pounds of meat, including 37 million pounds intended for the school lunch program.  “These ag-gag laws are putting the public at risk and they further erode what trust there is among Americans for the meat industry,” said Paul Shapiro, the society’s vice president of farm animal production. Well aware of the image and trust problems that the investigations and subsequent laws have created, some farm groups have decided to change their strategy — forgoing the usual political channels and instead communicating to the public the scope and use of animal care standards. “We’re going to step up now and figure out how to address the issue within our own community rather than relying on legislation to block information,” said Ryan Goodman, spokesman for the Montana Stockgrowers Association. “We do want to be open and transparent with the public and not come across as if we’re trying to hide something because we’re not. We’re just trying to protect our own families and businesses.” The livestock group has various social media accounts, including on Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest. He also writes a blog. “That comes across communicating the message a lot better than saying we went to the Legislature and lobbied on this issue,” Goodman said. Another concern about some undercover investigations is that video is edited down to short clips and narrated to distort the truth, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey said. “People were essentially creating false narratives and getting on farms and actually not even representing what was happening on those farms,” he said. “We want to make sure bad stuff isn’t happening out there. If somebody is doing something wrong it needs to stop, but some will try and paint the whole industry as those handful of outliers.” Chris Green, a spokesman for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, which along with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is a plaintiff in both lawsuits, said farm groups should be concerned about the public’s perception that slaughterhouses and farms are operating in the dark. “There’s this pro-whistleblowing sentiment that exists in the U.S. populace,” Green said. “Anything that indicates anti-whistleblowing indicates someone is trying to hide something from the American people and that doesn’t bode well.” Other states, including those that have tried and failed to pass ag-gag laws, will watch closely to see whether these two constitutional challenges hold up. But they might be waiting a while: The Idaho lawsuit, though recently filed, is not yet set for trial and deadlines for motions stretch into next year, and Utah’s is also just getting started.

New rules aim to rid US schools of junk foods,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — High-calorie sports drinks and candy bars will be removed from vending machines and cafeteria lines at all U.S. schools as soon as next year, replaced with diet drinks, granola bars and other healthier items. The Agriculture Department said Thursday that for the first time it will make sure that all foods sold in the nation’s 100,000 schools are healthier by expanding fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits to almost everything sold during the school day. The rules, required under a child nutrition law passed by Congress in 2010, are part of the government’s effort to combat childhood obesity. The rules have the potential to transform what many children eat at school. The regulations apply to snacks sold around the school and foods on the “a la carte” line in cafeterias, which never have been regulated before. The new rules, proposed in February and made final this week, also would allow states to regulate student bake sales. While some schools already have made improvements in their lunch menus and vending machine choices, others still are selling high-fat, high-calorie foods. Standards put into place at the beginning of the 2012 school year already regulate the nutritional content of free and low-cost school breakfasts and lunches that are subsidized by the federal government. However most lunchrooms also have the “a la carte” lines that sell other foods — often greasy foods like mozzarella sticks and nachos. Under the rules, those lines could offer healthier pizzas, low-fat hamburgers, fruit cups or yogurt, among other foods that meet the standards.  One of the biggest changes under the rules will be a near-ban on high-calorie sports drinks, which many beverage companies added to school vending machines to replace high-calorie sodas that they pulled in response to criticism from the public health community. The rule would only allow sales in high schools of sodas and sports drinks that contain 60 calories or less in a 12-ounce (0.35 liters) serving, banning the highest-calorie versions of those beverages. Many companies already have developed low-calorie sports drinks — Gatorade’s G2, for example — and many diet teas and diet sodas are also available for sale. Elementary and middle schools could sell only water, carbonated water, 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice, and low fat and fat-free milk, including nonfat flavored milks. First lady Michelle Obama, an advocate for healthy eating and efforts to reduce childhood obesity, pointed out that many working parents don’t have control over what their kids eat when they’re not at home. The Government Accountability Office said it visited eight districts around the country and found that in most districts students were having trouble adjusting to some of the new foods, leading to increased food waste and decreased participation in the school lunch program. However, the agency said in a report that most students spoke positively about eating healthier foods and predicted they will get used to the changes over time. The food industry has been onboard with many of the changes, and several companies worked with Congress on the child nutrition law three years ago.

Food pantries work to keep up with demand,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Eating is essential to survival, but what do people do when food isn’t available? Food pantries have become an essential source of sustenance for many people in the area. The services have moved, renovated and expanded in the past 30 years as their need continues to grow. While many people are grateful for the locally provided assistance, it also signifies the amount of people in need. The pantries are led by dedicated volunteers, but they can’t do it all alone. With federal regulations tightening, most pantries receive little government aid. They depend heavily on local donations, food drives and special events to help bring in supplies. It’s a constant struggle to keep replenishing. More people in need Sauk Prairie pantry board member John Ramthun said the amount of people served has grown through the years, and it rose significantly during the last recession. “It’s an important safety net,” Ramthun said. “At any moment, in any of our lives, we could be one or two situations away from needing help from a food pantry. What I love about this food pantry is that is it’s not intended to provide your entire menu of items for the month, but it’s there for folks who need it for a week, month or several years to get back on their feet.” With Reedsburg’s senior population on the rise, it’s important for seniors on a fixed income to have a place to receive food when money is tight.  “I don’t think our situation is a whole lot different from other communities,” said Reedsburg Food Pantry President Bess Little. “We have seniors and people with disabilities who can’t make it on social security payments alone.” The pantry usually sees more clients in August before the start of school. Once children are in school, they can utilize the school lunch program and some districts provide a light breakfast too. Reedsburg’s pantry also experiences more traffic in the winter when travel is limited. It’s a similar situation in Portage, according to pantry president Charles Bradley. “There are certain seasons when a lot of people come and then they might get back on their feet somehow so they’re on their own again, which is what we want,” Bradley said. “The numbers always bounce around and they don’t always make sense.” The one thing known for sure is the numbers are increasing. “About 20 years ago, we were providing food to about 30 households per month, so it has definitely grown through the years,” said Wisconsin Dells Community Action supervisor Lisa Williams. “But we seem to have finally hit a plateau where it doesn’t fluctuate as much anymore.” The holiday season can be an especially busy time for food pantries. Finances are often tight for people and utility bills can hit families hard in the early winter months. School shopping can also increase in November and December as parents are buying heavy winter clothes for their children. “We have a lot of people who rely on the food pantry just to get through the month,” said Baraboo Food Pantry Vice President and Secretary JoAnn Trager. “Those programs like Food Share, it helps, but there is still a need. Baraboo seems like an economically sound town, but there are plenty of people who have to choose between paying rent or buying food.” Sometimes those who need help feel too much embarrassment to seek it. “We’ve worked a lot on our seniors who come regularly every month, but we really want families to use the service more if they need it,” said Mauston Community Sharing Food Pantry Director Kathy Green. “We need to work with people and their schedules. We like to be flexible, but pride is a hard thing to overcome for a lot of people.” Sauk Prairie has also found some people to be reluctant to visit its pantry, but the volunteers do what they can to ease any tensions. “There are times when we have patrons who share what is going on in their lives and sometimes that involves some tears, but they are not alone,” said Sauk Prairie Area Food Pantry Manager Carol Gagnon. “Many of them are going through the same situations and will share their own stories to make them feel more comfortable.” Buildings grow as need grows Many food pantries start from humble beginnings, but Reedsburg’s started much smaller than most. The Reedsburg Food Pantry began in the closet of a downtown church. Through the years, the pantry relocated to a hospital before moving to its current location, inside the basement of city hall at 547 N. Park Street. The need for more space is a common refrain heard from pantries. Through a grant matched by community donations, the Mauston Area Community Sharing Pantry underwent an extensive expansion earlier this year. The new space will be unveiled to the Mauston community at an open house on October 16. It started with a very small space at St. Patrick Catholic Church in 1983 and now owns a building at 1 Kennedy Street. In July, Portage’s food pantry moved from the basement of St. Paul the Baptist Episcopal Church to Lincoln Park; 405 E. Howard Street. Bradley said the move was something the pantry discussed for a couple years. “We were looking to expand and considered a number of spaces, but they were out of our reach. We got a very good deal on the city building at Lincoln Park — a wonderful arrangement for us and we just knew we could not do better,” he said. “It was convenient for older and handicapped people and we seem to be quite able to make use of that space. Without the old stairs that we were dealing with at the church, we’re able to move food in a much more convenient method.” Sauk Prairie Area Food Pantry has outgrown its current space and plans to move into a new facility in early 2017. “It will allow us to have so much healthier food and space for fresh produce,” said Gagnon. Finding the funds Each food pantry finds a number of ways to provide as much food as possible. “We have had a lot of cooperation from the community, which is really nice,” Reedsburg’s Little said. “It’s all done on a volunteer basis and we do it without asking for any funds. We get a little bit of funding, but nothing from the government — nothing. We don’t need it.” Little said local donations provide much of the pantry’s food, and a small item can go a long way. One volunteer brings fresh vegetables from her daughter’s garden every summer, which is a treat to many of Reedsburg’s clients. Even a donated box of macaroni and cheese can provide a meal to someone who is hungry. “Many of the people we see live in apartments and can’t grow a garden,” Little said. “We are always looking for donations.” The Dells pantry does two fundraisers per year; a summer golf outing and serving as a stop for the Canadian Pacific Holiday Train each December. The Holiday Train also stops in Mauston and Portage. It is a large food drive for pantries, featuring raffles and live music. “We’re not sure when it will arrive this year yet, but it’s always around the first week of December, so we’re hoping for the same time again this year,” Williams said. Juneau County has five pantries that serve all of its school districts. Green said that shows the level of support neighboring communities have for food pantries. The pantry only receives about 10 percent of its products from federally-funded sources; the rest comes through donations and help from Second Harvest. It helps that Green is a steadfast grant writer who is always looking for opportunities to receive monetary support. Volunteers make everything possible Green, who has fibromyalgia, survived a bout with breast cancer, but was forced to give up her full-time job in the late 1990s. Not willing to sit at home and dwell, her doctor told her to find a volunteer cause she’s passionate about. She began volunteering at the pantry in Mauston 18 years ago and fell in love with it. “Giving people the best service with dignity is always a goal,” Green said. “It should be for any community. You can’t just pretend something is not there and hope it goes away. Giving people help without judging them is so important.” Little has worked with the pantry in Reedsburg for five years, but several dedicated volunteers have been with the organization for decades. “We would like to have a few more young people come in to help us,” Little said. “I really want to praise our workers and the people who donate items. All this wouldn’t work without them. We wouldn’t be here.” Even after 35 years at the Portage pantry, Bradley still has a passion for serving others. He said people in the community know the importance of having a steady pantry and there are plenty of citizens who need a little boost. While he’s put in many long days at the pantry, Bradley knows it’s worth it. “I’m absolutely amazed at the amount of food we are given and we’re using it all to make sure people are supplied,” Bradley said. “A lot it has to do with my religious beliefs. There are a few things that I believe are important and I think we should support the poor, especially in our community.” As he gets older, Bradley is looking for younger volunteers to take the reins, but for now, he’s dedicated to serving the Portage area. The Sauk Prairie pantry is grateful for the large amount of people it has dedicate time. “We have about 200 volunteers that help us through the year,” Gagnon said. “The community support is amazing. If I need volunteers, I can put an announcement on Facebook and almost immediately I have volunteers.” Baraboo’s Trager continues to find fulfillment after 18 years of service. “When you just realized that you’ve fed a family in need, it brings tears to your eyes,” Trager said. “To see the look on people’s faces is so gratifying.” In the end, it’s about helping people. “The bottom line is we do not want people to go hungry,” Green said.

(AP Photo/Cliff Owen) ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (AP) — They called it “random dancing” but First Lady Michelle Obama broke out some moves that resembled subdued variations of “the Monkey” or “the Jerk” Friday during an appearance at a northern Virginia high school. A screaming, raucous auditorium filled with elementary and middle school students greeted Obama and the cast of the Nickelodeon TV show “iCarly” at Hayfield Secondary School in Fairfax County. The appearance promoted an upcoming episode featuring Obama in which she thanks military families for their sacrifices. On the show, star Miranda Cosgrove plays the daughter of an Air Force colonel deployed overseas. A staple of the show is a segment of random dancing, which Obama performed both in the episode that premieres Monday and on stage Friday. Obama’s dance moves drew plaudits from the “iCarly” cast. “I think she showed everybody up in the dance department,” said Jennette McCurdy, who plays Samantha on the show. The onstage dance session Friday lasted only a minute or so, far less than the extended dance session Obama did last year when visiting Deal Middle School in the District, when she joined students doing “the Dougie” and “The Running Man” in a clip that has been viewed more than 4 million times on YouTube. Her acting skills also drew praise. The cast was impressed with Obama’s ability to deliver her lines in the compressed time they had to shoot the scenes.  “She has good comic timing in real life, too,” Cosgrove said. Obama said she watches the show with her daughters, and wanted to appear because it dovetails with her campaign to support and recognize military families. Last year, Obama went to northern Virginia to deliver the commencement address at the high school on Quantico Marine Corps Base. Hayfield, few miles south of the Pentagon, was chosen in part because it is home to large numbers of military children. During a question-and-answer session with students, Obama drew a handful of playful boos when she was asked about school lunches and talked about legislation she and her husband supported to add more vegetables to the school lunch program. Taking note of the reaction, she said, “But this is for you all. ... It’s hard to do what you do if you’re not healthy.” She concluded with a simple admonition: “Eat your vegetables.” She also handled other student questions: — Asked what super power she wished she could have, she said, “You know what? I’ve always wanted to fly. When I was young, I used to always have dreams about flying.” —Her favorite room in the White House? The Yellow Oval Room, which opens up to the Truman balcony. “It’s one of the few places the president can walk outside and be by himself,” she said. —Her favorite TV shows? Besides “iCarly,” Mrs. Obama said, “we watch all kinds of things. We try not to have too much TV time during the week, though.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

"Cut out junk food ads in schools, government says","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s not just about what America’s kids are getting in the lunch line. The Obama administration is moving to phase out junk food advertising on football scoreboards and elsewhere on school grounds — part of a broad effort to combat child obesity and create what Michelle Obama calls “a new norm” for today’s schoolchildren and future generations. “This new approach to eating and activity is not just a fad,” Mrs. Obama said Tuesday as she described the proposed rules at the White House. Promotion of sugary drinks and junk foods around campuses during the school day would be phased out under the Agriculture Department rules, which are intended to ensure that marketing is brought in line with health standards that already apply to food served by public schools. That means a scoreboard at a high school football or basketball game eventually wouldn’t be allowed to advertise Coca-Cola, for example, though it could advertise Diet Coke or Dasani water, also owned by Coca-Cola Co. Same with the front of a vending machine. Cups, posters and menu boards that promote foods that don’t meet federal standards would also be phased out. Ninety-three percent of such marketing in schools is related to beverages. And many soda companies already have started to transition their sales and advertising in schools from sugary sodas and sports drinks to other products they produce. Companies are spending $149 million a year on marketing to kids in schools, according to the Agriculture Department. The announcement at the White House was part of a week of events marking the fourth anniversary of the first lady’s “Let’s Move” program. Mrs. Obama also traveled to Miami Tuesday to announce that the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the National Recreation and Park Association will serve more fruits and vegetables at after-school programs and ensure kids get 30-60 minutes of physical activity a day. NBC’s “Parks and Recreation” star Amy Poehler introduced the first lady.  The proposed school marketing rules come on the heels of federal regulations that now require food in school lunch lines to be more healthful than in the past. Separate rules, which are to go into effect in September, will cover other food around school as well, including in vending machines and “a la carte” lines in the lunch room. Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits now will have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day, as mandated by a 2010 child nutrition law. Even though diet sodas would be allowed in high schools under the proposed rules announced Tuesday, the rules don’t address the question raised by some as to whether those drinks are actually healthful alternatives to sugary soda. Some healthful-food rules have come under fire from conservatives who say the government shouldn’t dictate what kids eat — and from some students who don’t like the new alternatives. Mrs. Obama defended herself against critics, saying that “I didn’t create this issue.” She said kids will eventually get used to the changes. “That’s our job as parents, to hold steady through the whining,” she said. Aware of the backlash, the Agriculture Department is allowing schools to make some of their own decisions on what constitutes marketing and is asking for comments on some options. For example, the proposal asks for comments on initiatives like Pizza Hut’s “Book It” program, which coordinates with schools to reward kids with pizza for reading. Rules for other school fundraisers, like bake sales and marketing for those events, would be left up to schools or states. Off-campus fundraisers, like an event at a local fast-food outlet that benefits a school, still would be permitted. But posters advertising the fast food may not be allowed in school hallways. An email to parents — with or without the advertising — would have to suffice. The idea is to market to the parents, not the kids. The rules also make allowances for major infrastructure costs — that scoreboard advertising Coca-Cola, for example, wouldn’t have to be immediately torn down. But the school would have to get one with a different message or product the next time it was replaced. Schools that don’t want to comply could leave the National School Lunch Program, which allows schools to collect government reimbursements for free and low-cost lunches for needy students in exchange for following certain standards. Very few schools choose to give up those government dollars, though. The beverage industry — led by Coca-Cola Co., Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and PepsiCo — is on board with the new rules. American Beverage Association President and CEO Susan Neely said in a statement that aligning signage with the more healthful drinks that will be offered in schools is the “logical next step.” The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposed rules, which also would allow more children access to free lunches and ensure that schools have wellness policies in place. The 2010 child nutrition law expanded food programs for hungry students. The rules being proposed Tuesday would increase that even further by allowing the highest-poverty schools to serve lunch and breakfast to all students for free, with the cost shared between the federal government and the schools. According to the Agriculture Department and the White House, that initiative would allow 9 million children in 22,000 schools to receive free lunches. The department already has tested the program in 11 states. Associated Press writer Kelli Kennedy in Miami contributed to this report.

"Rape remark defined Akin’s campaign, McCaskill win","Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri congressman Todd Akin called it his “six-second mistake.” As it turns out, his remark about “legitimate rape” was more than enough to sink his U.S. Senate campaign. Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill notched a resounding victory over her Republican challenger in Tuesday’s election, achieving the largest winning margin for a Missouri Senate race in 18 years despite entering the 2012 campaign as a self-described underdog. In hindsight, however, the outcome seemed almost inevitable. From the moment Akin won the Republican primary — even before then, in fact — McCaskill had been framing a race in which she would appear reasonable and her opponent extreme. She ran an effective advertising campaign financed by a considerable cash advantage over Akin. And she combined it with a door-knocking, phone-calling blitz that McCaskill says reached millions of homes. “I honestly believe that if it hadn’t been for that comment, there would have been another,” McCaskill said in a post-election interview with The Associated Press. “Yes, the comment on ‘legitimate rape’ dominated, but had he not said that, there was a lot of other material to work with.” McCaskill’s strategy to portray Akin as extreme was successful because she could cite the “legitimate rape” remark as the topper in a series of statements and positions taken by Akin. She highlighted his opposition to federally issued student loans, airing video of Akin describing how the loan program was an example of the government’s “stage three cancer of socialism.” Then, too, there was Akin’s opposition to the federal’s government’s role in setting the minimum wage, funding the school lunch program and establishing a national sex offender registry. McCaskill’s campaign distributed a daily count-down email entitled: “35 Days, 35 Ways Todd Akin is Too Extreme for Missouri.”  Akin countered that it was McCaskill who was too extreme for Missouri, particularly citing her support for President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus act and 2010 health care law — the latter of which had been symbolically rejected by Missourians in a 2010 ballot measure. But Akin’s message appeared to get drowned out by the reverberation from his own words. During an interview taped Aug. 17 at St. Louis television station KTVI, Akin was asked whether abortion should be legal for women who have been raped. “From what I understand from doctors, that’s really rare,” Akin said, referring to pregnancy in rapes. “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” The next day, Akin joined the rest of Missouri’s Republican ticket for statewide offices on a campaign swing to southwest Missouri, never anticipating the firestorm to come when the interview aired on Aug. 19. Social media sites quickly lit up with chatter. Soon Akin was being denounced and ridiculed nationwide. Top Republicans, including GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, urged him to quit the race. And millions of dollars of planned advertising evaporated almost overnight from deep-pocketed groups that typically back Republicans. “Akin was ahead when he was more of a theoretical candidate, right after the primary,” said Dave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. “He became virtually toxic after the legitimate rape comment. ... “It was the first thing Missouri voters knew about Akin, and it was something they didn’t like,” Robertson added. An exit poll conducted for the AP showed many voters were turned off by Akin’s remark. Nearly two-thirds of voters said that, at the very least, they gave the comment some consideration in the voting booth — and those who did overwhelmingly sided with McCaskill by a rate of almost three to one. Close to 70 percent of women said Akin’s remark about rape and abortion was important to their decision, and Akin couldn’t get the majority of men to look past that race-turning moment, either. “The man is not even in reality,” state worker Cindy King said after casting a ballot for McCaskill in Jefferson City. Akin repeatedly apologized for his remark and acknowledged he was wrong about rape victims having biological defenses against pregnancy. But McCaskill used the rape remark as a window into what she described as Akin’s out-of-the-mainstream beliefs. “I think a lot of Missourians who were vaguely aware of him were probably surprised by just how conservative he was,” said Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia. “McCaskill might have been able to pull it out even if he had not had that one particular mistake, but that played right into her hands.” Akin’s remark may also have affected other Republican candidates. In some states, Democrats sought to link their Republican opponents to Akin. In Missouri, the other statewide GOP candidates generally kept a silent distance from Akin. After conceding defeat to Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, Republican gubernatorial challenger Dave Spence cited the media storm spawned by Akin’s remarks “as one of the biggest influences on our race.” “There are only so many headlines in our state, and I think that race took all of them,” Spence told the AP. As a result, Spence said, Nixon “was able to duck debates, not answer any questions and play hide and seek with Missouri voters.” In the closing days before the election, Spence packed most of the statewide GOP candidates into his RV for a cross-state campaign swing. Akin was not among them. The state Republican Party said Akin had been invited but chose to do his own thing. On election night, Missouri’s prominent Republican candidates each held separate watch parties. Akin has shied away from the media spotlight after his defeat — just as he did in the days immediately following his “legitimate rape” remark. “Things don’t always turn out the way you think they’re going to,” Akin said to his supporters while conceding defeat. “But I also think that in the circumstances we’ve all been through, that it’s particularly appropriate to thank God, who makes no mistakes and who is much wiser than we are.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik) SOUTH SIOUX CITY, Neb. (AP) — Governors of three states got up close with “pink slime” Thursday, touching and examining treated beef at a plant and eating hamburgers made with it in a bid to persuade grossed-out consumers and grocery stores the product is safe to consume. The three governors and two lieutenant governors spent about a half hour learning about the process of creating finely-textured lean beef in a tour of the main plant that makes the product, then blasted the media for scaring consumers with a moniker coined by critics. “If you called it finely textured lean beef, would we be here?” asked Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback. Several other leaders echoed his comments as they tried to smooth over consumer concerns about the product. Beef Products, the main producer of the cheap lean beef made from fatty bits of meat left over from other cuts, has drawn scrutiny over concerns about the ammonium hydroxide it treats meat with to change the beef’s acidity and kill bacteria. The company suspended operations at plants in Texas, Kansas and Iowa this week, affecting 650 jobs, but defends its product as safe. The politicians who toured the plant — Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Brownback, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, Nebraska Lt. Gov. Rick Sheehy and South Dakota Lt. Gov. Matt Michels— all agree with the industry view that the beef has been unfairly maligned and mislabeled and issued a joint statement earlier saying the product is safe. “Why are we here today defending a company that has a rather sterling record dealing with making a food product that is very much needed in this country in a very safe manner? Why are we here today?” Perry said.  The officials spent about 20 minutes going over the production process in a separate room at the plant with Craig Letch, the company’s director of quality assurance, viewing and handling more than a dozen slabs of raw meat and the processed, finished product laid out on cutting boards on a round wooden table. The officials asked about the added ammonia, which Letch said is used as an extra safety precaution against E. Coli. “What we’re doing with ammonium hydroxide is directly targeting those specific microorganisms that could affect human health. It is nothing more than something to ensure consumer safety,” Letch said as the politicians bent over the raw cuts of beef. The officials donned hard hats, hair nets and goggles for a brief walking tour through the facility. Workers manned conveyor belts of meat cuts that ran from one side of the room to the other in the chilled room; the ammonium hydroxide treatment process was not visible; plant officials say that’s because it binds with moisture in the meat in an aerated process. Afterward, Perry, Branstad and others ate burgers made from the plant’s meat at a news conference. “It’s lean. It’s good. It’s nutritious,” Branstad said as he polished off a patty, sans bun. Larry Smith, with the Institute for Crisis Management public relations firm, said he’s not sure the makers of the product — including Cargill and BPI — will be able to overcome the public stigma against their product at this point. “I can’t think of a single solitary message that a manufacturer could use that would resonate with anybody right now,” Smith said. Russell Cross, a former administrator of the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, said the product is getting a bad rap from a food safety standpoint. “I’m not saying it’s perfectly safe. Nothing is perfectly safe. All food is going to have bacteria in it. But this product has never been in question for safety,” he said. Cross said that ammonia is just one tool designed to reduce bacteria and help make the food safer. The process Cargill uses, by comparison, uses citric acid to achieve similar results. The finished product contains only a trace of ammonia, as do many other foods, and it’s meant just to be an additional “hurdle for the pathogens,” said Cross, who is now head of the Department of Animal Science at Texas A&M University. The ammonium hydroxide BPI uses is also used in baked goods, puddings and other processed foods. National Meat Association spokesman Jeremy Russell said if consumers insist on eliminating the product from ground beef, prices will go up and lean beef trimmings will have to be imported to replace it. The process of creating lean, finely textured beef yields about 12 to 15 pounds of additional meat per animal. Russell said the outcry has already hurt BPI and other meat companies, and could eventually hurt the price that ranchers and feedlots receive for cattle. BPI did get some good news Wednesday when Iowa-based grocer Hy-Vee said it would offer beef with and without pink slime because some consumers demanded the option. But larger grocery store chains, such as Kroger, have stuck with their decisions to stop offering beef with pink slime. The real test may come later this year when school districts purchase meat from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for next school year. The USDA said earlier this month that it would give school districts a choice between 95 percent lean beef that contains pink slime and less-lean beef without it. Russell said school districts will have to decide whether they’re willing to spend roughly 16 percent more for beef without pink slime. The USDA this year is contracted to buy 111.5 million pounds of ground beef for the National School Lunch Program. About 7 million pounds of that is from BPI.

Bills seek end to farm animal abuse videos,"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — An undercover video that showed California cows struggling to stand as they were prodded to slaughter by forklifts led to the largest meat recall in U.S. history. In Vermont, a video of veal calves skinned alive and tossed like sacks of potatoes ended with the plant’s closure and criminal convictions. Now in a pushback led by the meat and poultry industries, state legislators across the country are introducing laws making it harder for animal welfare advocates to investigate cruelty and food safety cases. Some bills make it illegal to take photographs at a farming operation. Others make it a crime for someone such as an animal welfare advocate to lie on an application to get a job at a plant. Bills pending in California, Nebraska and Tennessee require that anyone collecting evidence of abuse turn it over to law enforcement within 24 to 48 hours — which advocates say does not allow enough time to document illegal activity under federal humane handling and food safety laws. “We believe that folks in the agriculture community and folks from some of the humane organizations share the same concerns about animal cruelty,” said Mike Zimmerman, chief of staff for Assembly Member Jim Patterson, R-Fresno, whose bill was unveiled this week. “If there’s abuse taking place, there is no sense in letting it continue so you can make a video.” Patterson’s bill, sponsored by the California Cattlemen’s Association, would make failing to turn over video of abuse to law enforcement within 48 hours an infraction punishable by a fine.  Critics say the bills are an effort to deny consumers the ability to know how their food is produced. “The meat industry’s mantra is always that these are isolated cases, but the purpose of these bills is to prevent any pattern of abuse from being documented,” said Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm animal protection for the Humane Society of the United States, which conducted the California and Vermont investigations. In Indiana, Arkansas and Pennsylvania it would be a crime to make videos at agricultural operations. The goal of the proposed California law, industry representatives say, is to halt any abuses quickly and get video evidence to government regulators within two days, not to impede undercover investigations by animal welfare groups. “The people doing this aren’t cops so I wouldn’t think it’s their job to build a case. The goal for all of us is to reduce instances of animal abuse,” said David Daley, a Cattlemen vice president and professor of agricultural science at California State University-Chico. Formal opposition to the California bill comes from the ASPCA, the Teamsters, the HSUS and dozens of others. They say these attempts by the agriculture industry to stop investigations are a part of a nationwide agenda set by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative think tank backed by business interests. ALEC has labeled those who interfere with animal operations “terrorists,” though a spokesman said he wishes now that the organization had called its legislation the “Freedom to Farm Act” rather than the “Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act.” “At the end of the day it’s about personal property rights or the individual right to privacy,” said spokesman Bill Meierling. “You wouldn’t want me coming into your home with a hidden camera.” Animal welfare advocates say all of the focus on secrecy is energy misspent. “I wish the cattlemen actually wanted to stop cruelty, not the documenting of cruelty,” said HSUS California director Jennifer Fearing. “One could think of a thousand ways for them to actually stop cruelty rather than waiting for people to make videos and turn them over.” Animal welfare advocates say law enforcement agencies do not have the time or inclination to work complex animal abuse and food safety cases, and that federal USDA inspectors in slaughter plants have turned a blind eye to abuse. When a USDA inspector at the Vermont plant was heard in 2009 coaching a plant worker on how to avoid being shut down, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack weighed in, calling the conduct “inexcusable.” In reaction to concerns, the USDA has been working to improve enforcement of its humane handling regulations over the past two years, including establishing an ombudsman position that accepts reports of violations. Last year 24 new positions in the Food Safety Inspection Service were dedicated to humane handling, said a high-ranking food safety official not authorized to speak publicly. That hasn’t slowed investigations or the bills designed to stop them. The Arkansas bill goes further than the others and would prohibit anyone other than law enforcement from investigating animal cases. Last year Iowa, a major egg-producing state, passed a bill making it illegal to deny being a member of an animal welfare organization on a farm job application. Utah passed one that outlaws photography. Most of the sensational videos of abuse in recent years are shot by undercover operatives who surreptitiously apply and are hired by the meat processors for jobs within the facilities. One recorded last year by Compassion over Killing at Central Valley Meats in Hanford, Calif. showed a worker standing on a downed dairy cow’s nostrils to suffocate it and others repeatedly shot in the head, prompting several fast-food hamburger to cancel contracts, at least temporarily. Animal welfare groups say investigations take weeks because the operatives nose around only when they aren’t performing the duties for which they were hired. An HSUS investigator was in the Hallmark plant in Southern California for six weeks between October and November 2007, when the nonprofit turned over to the local district attorney evidence that included fraud in the federal school lunch program because animals too sick to walk were being slaughtered. In January 2008, HSUS released the video to force the DA to act. Two employees were convicted of cruelty charges. Late last year, nine workers at a Wyoming pork processing facility were charged with animal cruelty after an HSUS video showed them kicking and tossing piglets and failing to euthanize a sow gravely injured by a worker while giving birth. In 2009, HSUS spent 21 days in the Vermont slaughterhouse where male calves born to dairy cows were killed for veal. “Believe me our investigators would like to be out of there as soon as possible. They’re stoic, they’re courageous, but they are not enjoying their work at all,” said Mary Beth Sweetland, director of investigations for HSUS. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
